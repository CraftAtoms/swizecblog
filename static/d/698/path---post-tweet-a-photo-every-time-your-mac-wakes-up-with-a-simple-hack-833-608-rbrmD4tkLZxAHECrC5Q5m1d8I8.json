{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Tweet a photo every time your mac wakes up with a simple hack","content":"<p>A few days ago there was a story on HackerNews about a guy who made a funky script to take a photo of himself every time he opened his computer. The original story was <a href=\"http://benjamin-meyer-home.blogspot.com/2011/01/1-10-photos-every-day-starting-in-2006.html\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Swizec's ugly mug\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Fdj3o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"336\" />\n<p>I immediately liked the idea, but wanted to do something more with it. The only natural step was to take a photo and instead of storing it locally, just uploading it to some url and tweeting it. So last night I sat down for an hour of hacking and patched together a bunch of scripts and voila #TweetAWakeup was born.</p>\n<p>You can view the photos live on twitter via the #<a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23TweetAWakeup\" target=\"_self\">TweetAWakeup</a> hashtag.</p>\n<p>If you want to make something like this, here&#8217;s a quick howto of as many steps as I remember. I guess someone could make a simple script to do this, but then it would lose some of its geeky appeal.</p>\n<p>Ok here&#8217;s what you do:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new\" target=\"_self\">Register an app on Twitter</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://imgur.com/register/api_anon\">Get an imgur API key</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http://www.bernhard-baehr.de/\" target=\"_self\">Sleepwatcher</a></li>\n<li>Install <a href=\"http://www.intergalactic.de/pages/iSight.html\" target=\"_self\">iSight CLI Image Capture</a></li>\n<li>Download and install <a href=\"https://github.com/marcel/twurl\">twurl</a> (you might have to update RubyGems with &#8220;gem update &#8211;system&#8221;)</li>\n<li>Download <a href=\"https://github.com/Swizec/random-coding/tree/TweetAWakeup\" target=\"_blank\">my helper scripts</a></li>\n<li>Authorize twurl as per instructions on <a href=\"https://github.com/marcel/twurl\" target=\"_blank\">github</a> (twurl authorize &#8230;)</li>\n<li>run &#8220;sudo launchctl load Â -w /Library/LaunchDaemons/de.bernhard-baehr.sleepwatcher-20compatibility-localuser.plist&#8221; (this makes sleepwatcher work)</li>\n<li>Edit ~/.wakeup Â and make it look something like this, obviously you should modify the path to suit your setup</li>\n<li>\n<pre>#!/bin/bash\r\n\r\n/bin/bash ~/Documents/random-coding/TweetAWakeup/TweetAWakeup.sh</pre>\n</li>\n<li>Go into TweetAWakeup/update.py and edit line 8 to match your imgur API key from step 2</li>\n<li>Go into TweetAWakeup/TweetAWakeup.sh and edit the paths to suit your setup</li>\n<li>You can change what the tweet will look like on line 6 &#8230; would be nice if you leave the hashtag ðŸ™‚</li>\n<li>Run &#8220;<span style=\"font-family: Consolas, Monaco, 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; line-height: 18px; white-space: pre;\">twurl alias tweet /1/statuses/update.xml&#8221;</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>And you&#8217;re done! Every time your mac wakes up from sleep it will take a photo with iSight, then wait 10 seconds and post it on twitter. The wait is there to give your computer supple time to connect to an internet.</p>\n<p>Obviously this whole thing is rather pointless, but I find it interesting. Maybe something awesome falls out over time and I get a neato introspection into my daily life &#8230; or better yet, a hawt sexy girl with no top will forget about this and accidentally post her boobies all over the internet then much funs will ensue.</p>\n<p>PS: hopefully I didn&#8217;t miss a step ðŸ™‚</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"20efe721-1ffb-587e-b59b-f261fc06eeb5"}}
