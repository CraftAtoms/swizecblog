{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Why trolling is a art","content":"<p>Yesterday I got into a bit of an argument over what trolling is and isn&#8217;t with @<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"@unmarketing\" rel=\"twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/unmarketing\">unmarketing</a> because he reposted a year old blogpost that describes what he believes trolling to be.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Theodor_Kittelsen_-_Skogtroll%2C_1906_%28Forest_Troll%29.jpg\"><img title=\"Forest troll.

(the irony of this is that the troll usually resides in his <a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_txnr5mob49s/R9oC8MV4iCI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/W8qkDILVxhA/s400/nerd2.JPG\" target=\"_blank\">mom’s basement</a>, and is horribly, horribly alone)</p></blockquote>\n<p>But I think this is wrong. Maybe one day a long time ago, back when <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Internet Relay Chat\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\">IRC</a> was still the only useful social network on all the vast internets, it was correct that trolls weren&#8217;t very sophisticated and turned to easy, stupid and plain insulting slurs and word plays to troll people. Although I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s exactly true either, surely even back then there proper trolling was already happening (wikipedia seems to alude to such).<br />\n<!--more--><br />\nBasically what @unmarketing, and many people in general to be honest, gets wrong is the lack of distinction between trolling and simply being a jerk. Jerky behaviour does not a troll make!</p>\n<p>Personally I would put trolling somewhere in the realm of performance art. A good troll isn&#8217;t about insulting people, it&#8217;s more about performing a clever set of actions to produce either a comical or, even better, an emotional response from anyone watching.</p>\n<p>Usually when the effect is comical, it&#8217;s at the expense of the person being trolled, while the emotional responses are usually elicited from the person or persons being trolled directly.</p>\n<p>In essence, the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Troll (Internet)\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_%28Internet%29\">internet troll</a> is to the internet what a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Stand-up comedy\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy\">standup comedian</a> is to the physical world. And the tactics don&#8217;t even differ very much!</p>\n<p>There is also a certain elegance that comes with trolling when done well, the best trolls in my opinion come from misapplying some basic principles ever so slightly to give us a convincing argument that simply doesn&#8217;t hold water under scrutiny. A good example of such are various examples of troll physics one can find all over the internet.</p>\n<p>But my favourite are the kind of trolls that put up a mirror for people to look into. They elicit an emotional response simply by posing questions people don&#8217;t like to think about, or asking explanations of things that people just simply take for granted. The troll doesn&#8217;t even say very much of substance, but rather guides the target to poke holes in their own arguments and view of the world.</p>\n<p>Or sometimes what constitutes a good troll is simply something that is neither funny nor very emotionally charged, but simply epic. A good example of such a troll would be last year&#8217;s nominations for TIME&#8217;s man of the year award things where <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"4chan\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan\">Moot</a> got on the cover of TIME because people from 4chan completely obliterated the voting process by not only putting him in first place, but also writing out &#8220;marble cake, also the game&#8221; with the first letters of the poll results.</p>\n<p>In short, don&#8217;t go around labeling every jerk online a troll because you really aren&#8217;t doing justice to the art of trolling when you do that.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.geekologie.com/2011/05/they-uh-dont-live-under-bridges-internet.php\">Internet Trolls, The Informative Infographic</a> (geekologie.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/05/21/you-really-should-go-see-troll-hunter\">You Really Should Go See Troll Hunter</a> (slog.thestranger.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://adventuresinsocial.wordpress.com/2011/03/12/fishing-for-trolls/\">Fishing for Trolls</a> (adventuresinsocial.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://laughingsquid.com/the-hard-knock-life-of-an-internet-troll/\">The Hard Knock Life of an Internet Troll</a> (laughingsquid.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2011/03/jon-cryer-on-conan-i-am-a-troll/\">Jon Cryer on Conan: I Am a Troll!</a> (thehollywoodgossip.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://connektd.wordpress.com/2011/03/18/positive-troll/\">Don&#8217;t reject a positive troll</a> (connektd.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=3c80f2dd-fde1-4652-b55b-7d147f2dc7ca\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6f796289-6213-5663-8a21-61707d28f992"}}
