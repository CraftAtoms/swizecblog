You too might want to use a DSLR as a webcam. If so, you&#39;re in luck because I&#39;m going to show you how to do it without relying on hacky screen capture tricks.</p>\n<p>Aren&#39;t webcams good enough? Sure. DSLRs are better, though.</p>\n<p>Why would anyone even want to do this?</p>\n<p>So the tiny square of your face looks better when you&#39;re <a href=\"https://www.liveedu.tv/swizec/\">livecoding</a> or screencasting. Very important! Gotta look good on that 200&#215;200 pixel image.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/vsvb0\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/vsvb0\">Webcam vs. Webcam with studio lighting vs. DSLR as webcam with studio lighting</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Also useful for serious coding tutorials (which I want to make more of this year).

Some of the software involved relies on the Canon SDK. If you don&#39;t have a Canon, this might not work.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Go to Github and download this random piece of software. ?<a href=\"https://github.com/v002/v002-Camera-Live\">Camera Live</a></p>\n<p>I downloaded the latest zip. You can compile from source, too.</p>\n<p>Camera Live 2 doesn&#39;t even have an icon. Running binaries you find online is totally safe, right?</p>\n<p>I haven&#39;t had any issues Â¯\\<em>(ãƒ„)</em>/Â¯</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Download and install <a href=\"http://camtwiststudio.com/\">CamTwist</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Run CamTwist, open settings, set fps to 30 and video size to 1920&#215;1080. You can go higher if your camera supports it. My Canon Rebel T6i does not, but it also didn&#39;t cost a few grand, so ya know.</p>\n<p>1920&#215;1080 @ 30 is much better than my webcam that can do 1280&#215;720 @ 30 on a good day.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Restart CamTwist.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Connect camera to computer. I used the USB cable that came with the base package. Iâ€™m getting the HDMI cable by mail soon. Not sure the HDMI cable is better, but it&#39;s harder for my bird to bite through.</p>\n<p><strong>You have to do this part every time</strong> ?</p>\n<p><strong>6.</strong> Shut down all Canon software.</p>\n<p><strong>7.</strong> Start Camera Live. It puts your camera in recording mode and starts something called a Syphon server.</p>\n<p><strong>8.</strong> Start CamTwist, click <code>View &gt; Main Window</code>. Double-click <code>Syphon</code>, choose <code>Live Server</code> as the source.</p>\n<p><strong>9.</strong> Enjoy your expensive webcam.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b68e6db5-4f35-5d9d-98fb-c2a4f9c7a86b"}}
