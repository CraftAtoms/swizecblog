Until five in the morning in fact and then because I couldn&#39;t quite get myself to sleep I watched sitcoms until six. Yes quite insane. Why is it that I couldn&#39;t sleep after something like eight hours of studying? Probably because my mind&#39;s gone crazy and turned into vectory mush.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I woke today at 11 the first thing I saw was the laptop blabbing sitcoms in my face so what&#39;d I do? Complain to the first random person on MSN &#8230; it&#39;s what geeks do. Honestly, it felt like I was having a studying hangover, how the hell did that happen? Never had a hangover from studying before &#8230;\n</p>\n<p>\nYou know what, not that I was having a hangover &#8230; I think I still am and the sad part is how I&#39;m facing another three or four hours of studying this bloody linear algebra so I can then go to the last minute preparations at school and then, lo and behold, take the midterm.\n</p>\n<p>\nI&#39;m overrun with joyous joy and exquisite ecstasy &#8230; yay woo, linear algebraic algebraism in three dimensional space.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"de813895-435a-5619-bdea-f79ef8924fec"}}
