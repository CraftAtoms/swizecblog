Most likely because I&#8217;ve been a bit swamped with a particular <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Probability and statistics\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_and_statistics\" rel=\"wikipedia\">probability and statistics</a> theory exam that I started <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Study skills\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_skills\" rel=\"wikipedia\">studying</a> for much too late and ended up having only a day and a half time to learn 300 pages of &#8230; stuff &#8230; by  heart.</p>\n<p>I guess the main lesson of the past couple of days has been that I <em>suck</em> at studying and should really make an attempt to plan these things better. But the thing is that slow studying where people study for a couple of hours a day and do this for two weeks &#8230; it just doesn&#8217;t work for me. I get distracted and lose the appropriate mindset for a specific topic.</p>\n<p>Specifically today I learned that some textbooks are superbly lame for studying from. You know that <a title=\"I learned two things today 30.8.\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-30-8/swizec/2308\">statics textbook</a> I laughed at a couple of days ago?</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a brilliant piece of study material. Just gorgeous compared to what a certain professor managed to come up with for <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Information theory\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory\" rel=\"wikipedia\">information theory</a>. The whole thing is barely twice as long as <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Claude Shannon\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Shannon&#8217;s</a> original article on the topic &#8230; most of the difference is due to different text setting and that a couple of formulae have rigorous proofs written down.</p>\n<p>Most of the textbook is just pages upon pages of formulae and proofs, without any real context given. Yay for good study materials!</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/prweb2011/8/prweb8749837.htm\">Classroom or Beach?
