{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Code monkeys","content":"<p>\nSo it&#39;s been decided, I am henceforth to write my thoughts or whatever into this blog on a bidaily schedule, that is every two days rather than twice a day. We can only speculate as to how long I&#39;ll actually be able to uphold this decision, but hopefully it&#39;ll be for a long long time.\n</p>\n<p>\nA few days ago my boss asked me if I know of anyone that needs a web development job since we&#39;re getting a lot of projects thrown at us and I won&#39;t be able to finish them all in time. And I said I&#39;d have to look into it, at this point excitement was fairly low.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen the next day my other boss said that if I don&#39;t find anyone my predecessor could always be rehired for a few projects, but that they&#39;d prefer hiring an assistant or two for me. This is where the excitement begun. Why this is significant exactly? Well it means I&#39;d get to tell people what to do rather than be merely their equal.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs it turns out I did find somebody who needs work and will be interviewing them come Tuesday. Now of course I won&#39;t be interviewing them alone (hello, my first giving an interview, I can&#39;t pull something like that off on my own), but I will be the most significant part in the decision making process if I understand everything correctly.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf all goes how I think it might I&#39;ll be somebody&#39;s very-low-level boss. Awesome.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"13ec09a3-7b26-5f10-a569-8c0e6ae84877"}}
