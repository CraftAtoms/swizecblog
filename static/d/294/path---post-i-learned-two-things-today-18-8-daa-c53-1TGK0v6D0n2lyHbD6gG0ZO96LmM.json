Used to always think that it was something special and particularly freaky that only lives inside Lisp. Today, for some reason or another, I went to read about it in a bit more depth &#8230; perhaps because I&#8217;m allowed on wikipedia and not much else and it was an article on wikipedia.</p>\n<p>Turns out whenever you don&#8217;t give a flying fuck about the type of an object but only care that it behaves like you expect, you&#8217;re magically doing duck typing.</p>\n<p>Another thing I figured out is that an hour of internet a day isn&#8217;t all that bad. Turns out when you&#8217;re not online 24/7 things become much less interesting &#8230; or your interestingness threshold goes up &#8230; &#8220;the internet&#8221; used to take me all day to get through, now I&#8217;m done in half an hour. It might not be enough to read all the articles that look interesting in depth, but it&#8217;s enough to scan over the HackerNews titles to get a feel for what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n<p>But the fact I can&#8217;t click on random links, or check what all those red alert numbers on my phone are &#8230; is killing me. That impulse you get to go spend some time on the interwebs &#8230; grargh.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"48aad7ab-6ddd-5ebe-98f5-8abb7c402e87"}}
