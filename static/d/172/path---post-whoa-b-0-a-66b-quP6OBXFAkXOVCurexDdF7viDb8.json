{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Whoa","content":"<p>Yesterday as I was going home from&#8230; somewhere&#8230; I saw two dudes arguing over a minor collision of their cars, a white Ford and a darkish something if I recall correctly, I thought to myself, heh they&#8217;re my age group. Then it hit me. Even only a year ago I would have thought that they are old geezers compared to me. Is it reall happening? Am I really getting old? I don&#8217;t want to be old, this is damn scary.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now that I&#8217;m a scared old bastard, this apparently does not mean that I am any the wiser or anything like that, mainly so because I spent a good part of the last two days reading through <a href=\"http://www.reallifecomics.com\">these archives</a> and not working on the comic at all. That&#8217;s right folks, not even a single line of it has been drawn, which means that the update is not really due any minute as was expected but rather&#8230; postponed indefinitely. Sure, it will by &quot;on time&quot; as it will be in the month of June, but when in the month of June noone can predict, hopefully very soon.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2d590a78-fd82-51c4-b981-32b9fe62639a"}}
