Since then I have done 4352 pomodoros &#8211; 1813 hours of pure focused productivity &#8211; and it&#8217;s been amazing.</p>\n<p>Starting out I took Pomodoro very seriously and would do everything into 25 minute blocks with 5 minute breaks. I would stop reading articles midword if my break was over, cut off conversations midsentence and be very very annoyed when I had to pee but Pomodoro hasn&#8217;t said it&#8217;s break time yet.</p>\n<p>I even did dishes and sweeping the floor in a pomodoro block.</p>\n<p>These days I&#8217;m more relaxed about it. Sometimes, when I&#8217;m writing, I even work off the clock and don&#8217;t turn the timer on. It&#8217;s usually a mistake because I get dragged onto the internet, but at least I don&#8217;t break my writing flow once I do actually get into it.</p>\n<p>All this time I&#8217;ve been using the first Pomodoro app I downloaded. Partly because it was the only real option at the time, partly because it was good enough and I didn&#8217;t care to check for others.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 420px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"My old pomodoro timer\" alt=\"My old pomodoro timer\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/1298?token=k5adja6V0Yp-UredWNc4u8OG9Cq1Cvb6WITJMkl2jmJ3SRao_bJJbC_iGWIm0oyhe-Ki9iDZcL7XwdUMMlcYaPU\" width=\"410\" height=\"614\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">My old pomodoro timer</p></div>\n<p>Just like a real timer. It ticks, it looks like a tomato. The ticking gave a cadence to my work and the tomatoness &#8230; well it&#8217;s kinda neat.</p>\n<p>But it was time for a change. Something simpler to go with the simplified iOS7.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simple-pomodoro-timer/id496191025?mt=8\">Simple Pomodoro Timer</a> by SourcePad.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a timer. It counts down 25 minutes. Then it counts down a break. Then it tells you break is over. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Done!\" alt=\"Done!\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/1300?token=EshjwdEKrJDztRZb-R47LxfqtymDesyo2ZpXoScUIBwTlE1afHP_c25m52kQE1xss1FmoL-kl82WzJoBHZT4nO0\" width=\"614\" height=\"410\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Done!</p></div>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mandate anything. After every pomodoro you can opt for a short break (5min) or a long break (20min). The old timer was more like a hover mum <em>&#8220;Oh you haven&#8217;t done four pomodoros yet in this session have you! No long break for you!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s quiet!</p>\n<p>While I might like the ticking, people working in the same room always found it obnoxious. If you do turn on the sound the timer will ding when it&#8217;s done.</p>\n<p>Which sounds exactly the same as my IRC notifications. It gets confusing.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Break timer\" alt=\"Break timer\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/1301?token=cU8cWnhgdORh15E868iLCQFLgwGMdOVrw5zVnNNaAVhrW5cVwfg38oA7A8aEdDdhjWFsW2aBozeoRVBCnFSZqDI\" width=\"614\" height=\"410\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Break timer</p></div>\n<p>One of the best features is that it takes up the whole screen. You can see what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing at a glance. Black screen == work time. White screen == break time.</p>\n<p>The old one used less than half the screen for this feedback &#8211; red or green tomato &#8211; and you had to squint at the timer to see the numbers.</p>\n<p>The only thing I don&#8217;t like about the new timer is that there is too much clicking. Work done, click for a break. Break done, click to go to timer, then click to start the clock. Sometimes you forget and suddenly it&#8217;s been a ten minute break or you&#8217;ve been working for forty minutes straight.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s super encouraging!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 624px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Back to work!\" alt=\"Back to work!\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/1302?token=g3lb5XNeDQsYjVhfVRVwywm5Gla4zfeJWsmj-FHi5WuYLkfx6FLf2mEiETXu4dikbekw60yuaQPMmEkJKa-w7YA\" width=\"614\" height=\"410\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Back to work!</p></div>\n<p>Green means go!
