Actually I learned the issue was tehre as soon as I got back home, but didn&#8217;t really have time to look into it &#8230; apparently it no longer supports WPA encryption and my router doesn&#8217;t support anything stronger than WPA. Sad, I know, but that&#8217;s what it is.</p>\n<p>The only symptom of this is an error report along the liens of &#8220;There is a timeout&#8221; and instantly dropping the connection. When I turn off encryption the damn thing connects happily as ever. Now granted WPA isn&#8217;t very strong, but it&#8217;s still stronger than nothing &#8230; the only sense I can see here is that <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apple\" href=\"http://www.apple.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Apple</a> wants to protect me from a false sense of security?</p>\n<p>Guess I&#8217;m getting a new <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Wi-Fi\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi\" rel=\"wikipedia\">wi-fi router</a> soon. Any recommendations?</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that it is much cheaper to buy <em>twelve</em>Â fluffy things for a whiteboard eraser than a new eraser. You can only buy twelve at a time otherwise I would have bought one since this one has lasted me what &#8230; two, three years? Well ever since I got a whiteboard at home anyway. So I think I&#8217;m good until the end of time with this batch.</p>\n<p>Of course I&#8217;ll lose them first and have to buy a new pack every time I want to replace. Good business model that, sell twelve times as much as the customer needs, produce endless amounts of waste.</p>\n<p>Oh and <a title=\"I learned two things today 21.8.\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-21-8/swizec/2275\">everyone got their postcards</a> today.
