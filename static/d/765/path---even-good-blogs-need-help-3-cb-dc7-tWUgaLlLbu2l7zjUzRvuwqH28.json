{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Even good blogs need help","content":"<p>Blogging has a very big problem over all, and it&#8217;s not the fact that most blogs out there simply suck, it&#8217;s that there are many great blogs out there, but because the people making them aren&#8217;t marketing geniuses they get lost in the sea of blogs. This is a problem writers used to have, so they invented managers, it&#8217;s a problem open source software had, so we invented OSS list sites that help spread the word of good software.</p>\n<p>Neither of these approaches will work very well for blogs. Managers are out of the question since blogging doesn&#8217;t really make that much money and we don&#8217;t want to pollute it with such mumbo jumbo anyway. Sites with lists upon lists of blogs won&#8217;t work either since they&#8217;re far too satured. So <a href=\"http://chuckwestbrook.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chuck Westbrook</a> had an awesome idea and I&#8217;m biting. In a blogpost entitled <a href=\"http://chuckwestbrook.com/great-content-no-readers/\" target=\"_blank\">How you can help end the problem of blogs with great content and no readers</a> he proposed a sort of reading group for blogs. We sign up for the idea, read a different blog every two weeks and if we like it &#8230; I guess we&#8217;re supposed to do what we do with all the stuff we like. Talk about it.</p>\n<p>Anything to find new blogs, let&#8217;s do this.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2e782a91-7458-5d2f-8943-50fc1ec33b83"}}
