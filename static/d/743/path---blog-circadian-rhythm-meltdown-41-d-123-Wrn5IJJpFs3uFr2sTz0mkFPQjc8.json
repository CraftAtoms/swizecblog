Lately though, it&#8217;s gotten absolutely bonkers.<img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Sunset from my window\" src=\"http://images.instagram.com/media/2011/04/05/e8f34ab0d63a46ff9108e40d81a466a6_7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"367\" height=\"367\" /></p>\n<p>Last Friday I actually got to sleep at a pretty reasonable hour, about 4am. This is still pretty normal. I got up at about 9 because there was some hiking I had to do. Ok sure, a bit earlier than my saturday usual, but fine. 6 hours of sleep is the daily norm after all.</p>\n<p>That evening I watched soe movies and somehow didn&#8217;t go to bed until around 6am. Yikes-ish. Still, got up at 11am. A it groggy and weird, but alright, 5 hours is sill pretty r easonable for a sunday right?</p>\n<p>I think Sunday to Monday was normal. Bed at aout 4, up at about 10. Yay, let&#8217;s put the weirdness of the weekend behind us.</p>\n<p>And then came Monday night. I had some work to do, but eventually fell asleep at about 4:30 anyway.</p>\n<p>Now the fun begins.</p>\n<p>I got up at 7:30.</p>\n<p>All refreshed and sooper hyper most of the day. I practically danced to work rather than walked.</p>\n<p>The eening shifted tides on me though. Suddenly I was very fucking sleepy and when my face started feeling like a mask and I couldn&#8217;t recognize myself in the mirror (iphone camera) anymore I went to bed &#8230; at 10pm.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t gone to bed at 10pm since I was twelve!</p>\n<p>But guess what? I got up at 3 fucking am!</p>\n<p>3am! That&#8217;s my usual bed time damn it. So not only did I completely waste one of the most productive parts of the day, I was now awake through the sleepiest part of the day.</p>\n<p>Not sure what&#8217;s going on, but it&#8217;s being bloody stupid.</p>\n<p>PS: there&#8217;s a good article on weirdos who don&#8217;t need sleep over at <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703712504576242701752957910.html\">Wall Street Journal</a></p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=15b65a58-9f3b-4a5d-806d-553bc7d4a89a\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"48a29513-4df1-574e-bcf4-97481529d0d4"}}
