There&#8217;s this guy! I&#8217;ve been teaching him coding! He&#8217;s already better than me! Hasn&#8217;t even heard of a variable before a month ago! It&#8217;s so frikkin&#8217; awesome!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>He made me promise to blog about it. Why is it some people just <em>get</em> it? What&#8217;s so special about them? Can anybody be taught to program or does it really take a special breed to become even a competent programmer, let alone a good one?</p>\n<p>I remember tutoring a high school kid about a year ago. About to fail his <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Computer programming\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming\" rel=\"wikipedia\">programming</a> class (CE high school, we have those), he came running to me. In a month I was to teach him everything I know, or at least enough to pass the class.</p>\n<p>Come end of the month and he knew everything about loops, variable assignment, even understood that functions are packets of code that can do stuff. My parting words to his father were <em>&#8220;Yeah, he knows everything. Just needs a bit of practice to get it.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I doubt he ever passed the class. Or if he did it was the teacher&#8217;s mercy &#8230; and that teacher isn&#8217;t very merciful from what I remember of her in my high school times.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t just because I&#8217;m a bad teacher &#8211; others came to me after that one kid on his recommendation and I got a <em>&#8220;Thank you! I bloody passed! yay!&#8221;</em> email from all of them &#8211; there are people who simply aren&#8217;t programmers. Never <em>will</em> be programmers.

Only <strong>44%</strong> of the students formed a consistent <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mental model\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_model\" rel=\"wikipedia\">mental model</a> of assignment &#8211; even a wrong one. The rest failed or didn&#8217;t answer the questions.</p>\n<p>Worse still, after a semester of learning to program, the numbers were the same. Only 44% of the students understood how assignment works.</p>\n<p>Some people just dont <em>get</em> it.
