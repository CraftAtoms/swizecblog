After writing I was certain it wasn&#8217;t that interesting, sure it might be HN frontpage worthy &#8211; it never got there &#8211; but other than that I felt it wasn&#8217;t a very informative post, just musings of a hacker who has always loved the night-time.</p>\n<p>The internets had other plans. Some guy posted it on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">reddit</a> about half an hour after I published and for the next 30 or so hours it was at the top of /r/programming. Even showing up on the main frontpage briefly according to people on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Twitter</a>, I wouldn&#8217;t know, my reddit karma is 4.</p>\n<p>As is the trend when extraordinary traffic happens on a personal site, I will now <del>brag about</del> share the stats.</p>\n<p>Analytics for the last four days:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>167,939 visits</li>\n<li>157,707 uniques</li>\n<li>188,707 pageviews</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The peak day was Friday and saw just over 89k visitors. Because gAnalytics offers that real-time thingy, I can also say that the peak traffic I saw was about 600 concurrent visitors and for the first five or so hours it was up on reddit, the mean was something like 400 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Concurrent user\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_user\" rel=\"wikipedia\">concurrent users</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3221\" style=\"width: 723px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-20-at-4.50.42-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3221 \" title=\"30 day analytics\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-20-at-4.50.42-PM.png\" alt=\"30 day analytics\" width=\"713\" height=\"299\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-20-at-4.50.42-PM.png 1019w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-20-at-4.50.42-PM-300x125.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">30 day analytics</p></div>\n<p>If you&#8217;re so awesome this doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot &#8211; my usual monthly traffic is around 30k visitors. We are talking about <em>four days</em>¬†here.</p>\n<p>There was also a lot of social madness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1,714 points on reddit (2,866 upvotes, ¬†1,152 downvotes)</li>\n<li>40 upvotes on HN, no frontpage, just people submitting the article over the four days</li>\n<li>627 G+</li>\n<li>2,877 tweets</li>\n<li>550+ tweets mentioning me next to the link (hard to measure since search API only returns up to 1500 results)</li>\n<li>288 new followers on twitter &#8230; I should probably take the time to follow some back</li>\n<li>unknown amount of facebook likes, because I never quite got around to setting up the widget or Insights properly</li>\n<li>475 comments on reddit</li>\n<li>173 comments on my blog</li>\n<li>some emails directly to me</li>\n<li>three or four people looking for a freelancer</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ak-26.ru/?p=1258\" target=\"_blank\">somebody even translated the post to Russian</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>How all of this happened? I honestly haven&#8217;t a clue, there are tens if not hundreds of posts on this blog more deserving of such infamy, but I guess people like a good pat on the back and an easy <em>&#8220;Yeah totally. I can totally agree with that!&#8221;.</em></p>\n<p>The best bit of feedback came not from programmers, all of them were just &#8220;Yeah me too!&#8221; or &#8220;You&#8217;re an idiot!&#8221;, nope, the best were their wives and people who have to live with programmers claiming that now they can finally understand their werewolf programmer and how it thinks. Makes me feel I accomplished something with the post üôÇ</p>\n<p>Oh and the most surprising thing here? The post was 900 words long! Should be a death sentence on the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Internet\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\" rel=\"wikipedia\">intarwebs</a>, but I guess I made good enough points early on so people still wanted to share.
