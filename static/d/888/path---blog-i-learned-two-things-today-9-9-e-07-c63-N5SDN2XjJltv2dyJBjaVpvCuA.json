Apparently I have gotten too old to withstand a week of focused studying and then having the energy to go out on Friday. Seriously, my body and mind just don&#8217;t want to do it.</p>\n<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m just a nerd and the whole friday night thing takes too much of my energy anyway and isn&#8217;t actually as relaxing as some people find it.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that some people consider sex to be a very strange thing. Got into a discussion about marriage and stuff with a religious guy (one of those that actually decides to <em>become</em>Â religious in their late teens, yeah) &#8230; technically this was last night &#8230; at one point we came to the agreement that marriage only matters if you intend to have kids, but he added that if you don&#8217;t intend to have kids then you don&#8217;t need to have sex anyway and the whole discussion is moot.</p>\n<p>This figuratively kept me up all night and today I jotted down my thoughts on the matter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<pre>Happiness is getting the last cookie from the box, \r\nit's that kiss from a hot girl before she even knows your name, \r\nit's a box of chocolates from a stranger, \r\na hug from the person you secretly adore, \r\nthe awkward smile on the bartendress when you pay her a random compliment, \r\nhappiness is a bunch of small little things,\r\ndo something small for a change,\r\nlet the big things in life take care of themselves,\r\nthey always do.</pre>\n</blockquote>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/09/why-men-are-not-eager-to-get-married-today/\">Why Men are not eager to get Married Today</a> (vanguardngr.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.dumblittleman.com/2011/09/keys-to-leading-happy-and-fullfilled.html\">Keys to Leading a Happy and Fullfilled Life</a> (dumblittleman.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.fitsugar.com/Banana-Carob-Protein-Bar-Recipe-18559665\">A Reader Recipe: Banana-Carob Protein Bars</a> (fitsugar.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=006d3483-1e9d-4e2e-b30a-5772c4b0a551\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"488abf4d-54c8-5e1a-8902-4059423b7ce2"}}
