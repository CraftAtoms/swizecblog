Half the people in this house seem to be drinking it every day and loving every little sip of the thing. Went and bought some &#8230; tasted it &#8230; after two sips I donated it. And I generally really like coconut, but this water thing is just no good.</p>\n<p>Not sure how to describe the taste, but it&#8217;s not unlike someone smeared broccoli dipped in milk and mashed together with a touch of mansack sweat all over my tongue. And that&#8217;s not doing justice to the taste of mansack sweat.</p>\n<p>I also learned never never never to have a set of code in only one location on only one computer. Working on a small prototype of a prototype of something and we decided to only use local git repositories because it would be too much of an unneeded pain to have something on a real server somewhere.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I did something stupid and lost a day of work.</p>\n<p>Was moving some directories around &#8230; removed the wrong one. Poof. Code gone. All my modifications just fucking vanished into thin air. Yay for me!</p>\n<p>Git sucks for backup and making sure work doesn&#8217;t vanish when you accidentally the whole thing.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.fitsugar.com/Benefits-Coconut-Water-Dehydration-18275172\">Need to Beat the Heat?
