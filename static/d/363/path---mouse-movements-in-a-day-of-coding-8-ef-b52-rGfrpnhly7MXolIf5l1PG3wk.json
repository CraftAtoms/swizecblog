Sure it&#8217;s nice and comfy, but how much do I actually use it? When you pay close to a hundred euro for something you want to make sure it&#8217;s doing its job.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I tried.</p>\n<p>For the whole day, when the freelancing clock was running, so was <a href=\"http://iographica.com/\" target=\"_blank\">IOGraph</a> &#8211; a handy tool for recording mouse movements.</p>\n<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/a-day-of-coding.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-6169\" title=\"A day of coding\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/a-day-of-coding-1024x363.png\" alt=\"A day of coding\" width=\"717\" height=\"254\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/a-day-of-coding-1024x363.png 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/a-day-of-coding-300x106.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/a-day-of-coding.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></a>\n<p>I have dual screens, am running <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ubuntu (operating system)\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Ubuntu</a> and use <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Emacs\" href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Emacs</a> to write code. Certainly the sort of environment that favours using your keyboard over your mouse and yet, the mouse gets used quite a lot.</p>\n<p>The image above shows paths my mouse has taken through the day, dots show where the mouse has been standing still for a while &#8211; the bigger the dot, the longer the time &#8211; and I am honestly not certain what the circles around small black dots are. Clicks perhaps?</p>\n<p>Other than the fact I use my mouse more than I thought,Â three patterns emerge.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is a blank space roughly down the middle where I never place my mouse &#8211; the dividing line between two monitors. You can see the left is wider than the right.</li>\n<li>Despite being used a lot, the mouse spends most of its time <strong>standing still</strong>. Most of the image is taken up by relatively few very large black dots. The largest two are right where I had two terminal windows that I often switched between (one running a server instance, the other used for git). The rest are mostly on the far right where I have my browser. Apparently I like to click around, then leave the mouse there when I go back to coding? Or maybe page loads are slow?</li>\n<li>Emacs takes up the left half of the screen. I sometimes put my mouse here, but rarely for long because the cursor gets in the way.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can also notice I spend a lot of time switching the last few tabs in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http://www.google.com/chrome\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome</a>, possibly opening and closing them as I browse the interwebs for help with <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ruby (programming language)\" href=\"http://www.ruby-lang.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby</a>? That&#8217;s all the lines going to the upper right corner.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a screenshot of the desktop as I left it last night. Most of the tabs already closed because I have to save memory, but you can still see the rough layout of the windows I worked with. Had I some photoshop skill I&#8217;d overlay IOgraph output over the screenshot.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6171\" style=\"width: 829px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Workspace-1_193.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-6171 \" title=\"Workspace\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Workspace-1_193-1024x363.png\" alt=\"Workspace\" width=\"819\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Workspace-1_193-1024x363.png 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Workspace-1_193-300x106.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Workspace-1_193.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Workspace</p></div>\n<p>Now I wonder if mouse patterns are different for other languages and technology stacks &#8230; I have experimenting to do!</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=638e0b4f-5b2f-4a1e-9476-a1d85e6bdfd9\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1f4c336d-26f0-5f1a-9011-6f479e733271"}}
