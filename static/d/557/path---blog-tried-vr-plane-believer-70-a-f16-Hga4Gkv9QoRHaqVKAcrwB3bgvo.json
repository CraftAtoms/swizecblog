You put on a pair of bulky goggles, tripped over wires, and manipulated a heavy pen thing attached to even more wires, and you could paint in 3D space.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/20185137108cda207ed273cf29d9953e-metelkova-mesto.jpg\"><img src=\"https://lonelyplanetimages.imgix.net/a/g/hi/t/20185137108cda207ed273cf29d9953e-metelkova-mesto.jpg\" width=\"600\" class=\"size-large\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I don&#8217;t have photos of that night, but this is the building.</p></div>\n<p>Head and pen tracking were done through cameras attached to the ceiling. ARKit-style gyro chips were far in the future still, barely a dream.</p>\n<p>It almost worked. You got nauseous after 60 seconds.</p>\n<p>My friend was very proud of his art installation. There was a line out the door.</p>\n<p>The next time I almost tried VR was at a conference. There was a headset, some sort of early Oculus, with a rollercoaster experience. No interaction, just sit there and get seasick.</p>\n<p>There was a line out the door, I got impatient and left. The public 2D screen of what people see looked like fun.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d get nauseous after 5 to 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Last year, I finally tried real VR. A room scale sort of thing with 6 dimensions of freedom or whatever it&#8217;s called. You had goggles with a bunch of wires attached to a strong computer, and I think cameras on the ceiling somewhere. The controllers were wireless this time.</p>\n<p>You could paint and move and it was fun for about 2 minutes and then you&#8217;d get bored. The line wasn&#8217;t too long. Every techie got jaded about VR long ago.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fun but useless.</p>\n<p>Nausea after 20 to 30 minutes. Wires everywhere. Need a gaming rig to play. Cumbersome.</p>\n<p>Last week, I got an Oculus Go, and holy shit, my life changed forever.</p>\n<h2>Oculus Go changed my life</h2>\n<p>Oculus Go is everything I always wanted in a VR headset.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s self-contained, meaning there are no wires to get tangled in, no powerful gaming rig you have to buy, no fancy cameras to set up, and no large empty room you need.</p>\n<p>No phone to plug-in either. You put it on, press a button, and you&#8217;re in VR. You don&#8217;t even need to turn it on. Somehow it always knows when it&#8217;s on your face and turns on.</p>\n<p>Plus it&#8217;s small enough to fit in your backpack next to a book and other knickknacks you need on a plane. ðŸ‘Œ</p>\n<p>Best thing? No nausea.</p>\n<p>You can spend <em>hours</em> inside VR, and you never get nauseous or anything. You just have to remember to blink. Yes, it&#8217;s a problem. Your eyes go dry and start to itch.</p>\n<p>Sure, it&#8217;s sit-down VR that doesn&#8217;t do much more than put a fancy display up on your face, but there&#8217;s a lot you can do with that and a controller. There are fun games (I like shoot-em-ups), you have social experiences watching movies and Netflixâ€¦ there are even experiences where someone took a 360-degree camera on an adventure.</p>\n<p>My mum loved those. So did my grandma. They were blown away by just staring into the abyss of the Grand Canyon. Said they never realized how deep it was.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Did I tweet this yet?

It&#8217;s like IMAX on your face. Your immersion is surprisingly good even when watching 2D content. I think it&#8217;s the 3D sound.</p>\n<p>Like, you&#8217;re watching Star Trek, and you&#8217;re surprised to find yourself in your bed when the goggles come off. Or on a plane.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to explain how shocking it is to realize you&#8217;re in a mundane location when you take off the goggles. I&#8217;ve never experienced anything like it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a lie. It&#8217;s like when you hyperventilate in a grassy field to make yourself pass out for 2 seconds when you&#8217;re a stupid 12-year old. Coming out of VR is just like that moment when you come out of having passed out and everything feels a little off, a little unreal, like the place you just left is the real reality.</p>\n<p>VR really is the future.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wow thereâ€™s a lot more VR out there than I thought.

There&#8217;s only so far you can go with arcade stuff.</p>\n<p>And the resolution isn&#8217;t quiiiiiiteeee there to read articles comfortably. I see a lot of promise in VR browsers, especially if they improve it to where you can have multiple windows strewn around virtual space.</p>\n<p>That would be great for research. Like that scene in Snow Crash where Hiro has bits of info strewn about so it looks like he&#8217;s in a galaxy.</p>\n<p>I want to do everything in VR now ðŸ˜€</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"20339ed7-18eb-5cd5-9dc8-3f9083e5b35f"}}
