Doublerecall seems to have decided that when a launch page is made for something we&#8217;re thinking about Swizec is the guy who will figure out how to get enough traffic to run a valid experiment. Thing is &#8230; I don&#8217;t know the first thing about doing that. Sure, I sometimes get lucky and get 6k visitors to some random things I say about the <a title=\"Living life in 25min increments\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/living-life-in-25min-increments/swizec/1859\">pomodoro technique</a>Â and stuff like that.</p>\n<p>The real difficulty is in doing this consistently, figuring out what works, what doesn&#8217;t and being able to produce thousands of traffic to a random webpage with at least a hint of regularity and reliability.</p>\n<p>I learned that maybe e-marketers might be useful people too.</p>\n<p>Today I also learned that despite how many times I spill my glass of water after putting it on the floor next to my bed when I decide to work on the bed I will never learn to stop doing that. It&#8217;s just so convenient and the ratio of spilling the drink versus the times I don&#8217;t just isn&#8217;t enough to trip up my learning process apparently &#8230; that is to say, the force of being lazy is just stronger.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-1-8/swizec/2054\">I learned two things today 1.8.</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/2037/swizec/2037\">I learned two things today 30.7.</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-29-7/swizec/2022\">I learned two things today 29.7.</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/living-life-in-25min-increments/swizec/1859\">Living life in 25min increments</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://codeartists.posterous.com/codeartists-team-was-invited-to-y-combinator\">CodeArtists team was invited to Y Combinator S11 Interview with DoubleRecall project</a> (codeartists.posterous.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=cc5e9b01-b047-4525-afc9-5e13d304886b\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"18261691-9c74-57fc-921d-88d60cd86f70"}}
