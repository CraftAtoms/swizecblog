There&#8217;s no income and the only money I have was in the form of my dad owing me roughly 700 euro and the ounce of gold located somewhere in my apartment, also worth roughly 700 euro.</p>\n<p>Well last week the situation became a tad dire in that I&#8217;ve run out of moneys on my bank account as well and now despite having what is essentially two+ month&#8217;s worth of money at hand&#8217;s reach, I can&#8217;t even afford the bus fare to visit my girlfriend &#8211; yes, I stole it from mum&#8217;s change jar, ha!</p>\n<p>Of course I could just sell the gold, but it&#8217;d be at a loss since it was worth about 50 euro more when I bought it than it is now, and considering all the fees for the brokers and such the loss would be even greater since I need the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Gold as an investment\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_as_an_investment\">gold price</a> to be 6% higher than upon purchase to work out evenly. So I&#8217;m not selling the gold, that&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m an idiot, maybe I just have too much self discipline, but whatever it is, it reminds me greatly of The Marshmellow Experiment some evil scientist played on innocent little children.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/M0yhHKWUa0g&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/M0yhHKWUa0g&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>To be honest, I have no idea why I&#8217;m doing this to myself. Perhaps deep down I sensed I don&#8217;t have enough discipline and decided to do an exercise in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Deferred gratification\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_gratification\">impulse control</a>. Perhaps it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m a bit silly.</p>\n<p>Whatever it is, I&#8217;m certainly not having a lot of fun right now and once that credit card bill comes in at the end of the month, I&#8217;ll be having even less fun.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/56cd336e-16b0-4c06-babd-0825710ede6d/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=56cd336e-16b0-4c06-babd-0825710ede6d\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c18ac649-970d-5c7c-bdaa-2396d402ad39"}}
