After all, that was my experience before going full time.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve since discovered a few things.</p>\n<p>Luckily<strong> lead generation</strong> is simple as ever. While my blog has all but dried up as a lead generator because of lessened traffic, having a well connected friend or two really helped in getting introduced to people who might need my help. Posting on the monthly HackerNews <em>Seeking Freelancer</em> converted two or three times. I&#8217;ve heard good things of oDesk and might start using it.</p>\n<p>Note to self: start measuring conversion rates for introductions. Important stuff.</p>\n<h2>Everything takes too damn long</h2>\n<p>I used to spend up to 40 hours every week on classes, homework and studying, leaving just 15 to 20 hours to work on sideprojects, freelancing and more importantly &#8211; closing deals.</p>\n<p>Because <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-i-only-work-with-startups/swizec/2936\" target=\"_blank\">I prefer to work with startups</a> my &#8220;The Client&#8221; can be described as <em>a scatterbrained, overworked individual who will not look for help until things are literally splitting at the seams and their world is falling apart.</em></p>\n<div style=\"width: 293px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Longcat\" src=\"http://cache.ohinternet.com/images/5/5c/Longcat.jpg\" alt=\"Longcat\" width=\"283\" height=\"512\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Longcat</p></div>\n<p>As such, this is what my sales cycle looks like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get lead</li>\n<li>Send email</li>\n<li>Wait two days for reply</li>\n<li>Agree on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Skype\" href=\"http://skype.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Skype</a> meeting</li>\n<li>Reschedule Skype meeting 3+ times</li>\n<li>Skype chat &lt;a week later&gt;</li>\n<li>Negotiate basic contract</li>\n<li>Sign contract &lt;2 weeks later&gt;</li>\n<li>Receive tasks &lt;3 weeks later&gt;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Usually this wasn&#8217;t a problem. I had plenty of things to keep me busy and could barely keep up with the speed of interaction myself. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t even notice it took that long and there were so many steps!</p>\n<p>Now?</p>\n<p>Well &#8230; heh &#8230; now <em>eeeeverything is paaaainstaikingly sloooooooow</em>. So very very slow. Two or three days to reply? Are you daft man! I want this project tomorrow, get cracking immediately. My coding fingers are twitching with excitement!</p>\n<p>Oh and let&#8217;s not forget many projects don&#8217;t even make it through all those stages. Some fall off because they can&#8217;t afford me, others scrape whole projects after a pivot, some find a local freelancer and feel that might be easier to work with.</p>\n<p>Out of ten leads, three might come to a signed contract and some actual work. And yes, I do need to optimize those steps and, indeed, start measuring what the drop-off rate actually is.</p>\n<h2>Lost in time</h2>\n<p>Some deals close quicker than others, so I was not without work this month. Yay.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/frenchy/4328096189/\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Lost in time, by notfrancois\" src=\"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2683/4328096189_ac4b8738df.jpg\" alt=\"Lost in time, by notfrancois\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lost in time, by notfrancois</p></div>\n<p>But while I rant and rave about the time it takes to close deals, when it comes to actually getting some work done &#8230; that&#8217;s surprisingly difficult.</p>\n<p>Without external time-compression from classes and homework deadlines, I thought I could get massive amounts of work done every single day. Instead, I can&#8217;t seem to fit more than five or six hard billable hours into the day. Just doesn&#8217;t happen, time has become somewhat gooey and stretchy.</p>\n<p>You wake up, do some exercise, eat breakfast, shower etc. It&#8217;s 11am.</p>\n<p>You write a blogpost for the day. It&#8217;s 1pm, sometimes later.</p>\n<p>You make some lunch. Deal with a Skype meeting or two from all those deals you aren&#8217;t closing quickly enough. Perhaps do a bit of paperwork because banks and such close early.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s 4pm.</p>\n<p>You finally get to work, are interrupted a million times by chores and people who don&#8217;t understand you <em>are </em>working from home and before you know it, it&#8217;s time for dinner.</p>\n<p>Another massive interruption, takes a while to get back in the groove and it&#8217;s almost midnight. Get to inbox zero for the day and you&#8217;re too tired to get back to work.</p>\n<p>Voila, nine to ten hours of productively spent time, less than six billable hours. Magic.</p>\n<h2>Getting paid</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 344px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/stevendepolo/3354726208/\"><img title=\"Please pay here, by stevendepolo\" src=\"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3562/3354726208_0cce729fc8.jpg\" alt=\"Please pay here, by stevendepolo\" width=\"334\" height=\"500\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Please pay here, by stevendepolo</p></div>\n<p>And yet, despite all that. Despite working your arse off to fit at least thirty billable hours into a week, you are working at <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Speed of light\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">light speed</a> compared to your clients. <em>Especially</em> when you aren&#8217;t working on the core product, but something they would really like to have. Probably.</p>\n<p>Lack of pressure doesn&#8217;t help with time gooeyness.</p>\n<p>Sign up for a short project. Get enough materials to start. Exceed expectations, get everything done in a week &#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230; aaand wait a week for the client to look at your deliverable and decide if there&#8217;s any bugs. Two weeks later, you still haven&#8217;t received the final piece of materials needed to finish the project, put a bow on it and make the delivery.</p>\n<p>Then get paid in full. Because an XX% advance will only get you so far. You still need the actual money.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to avoid non-paying clients so far. They either pay immediately or at their own pace, but in a timely manner. The real problem are indecisive clients who take too long to say <em>Okay, we&#8217;re done.</em> and clients who are too busy to provide everything you need.</p>\n<h2>&#8230;</h2>\n<p>While they can afford to take forever, I simply don&#8217;t have that sort of runway. Take on more projects in the meantime? Of course. Eventually get swamped when everything goes through at once? Naturally.</p>\n<p>Being a full time freelancer is tricky, but I love it completely.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul zemanta-article-ul-image\" style=\"margin: 0;
