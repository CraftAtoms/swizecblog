{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Empires","content":"<p>Haven&#8217;t posted in quite a while, been busy and when you add a pinch of lazy to the mix you get some pretty powerful magic.</p>\n<p>In the past week I&#8217;ve discovered two very interesting and awesome things. One is browser based gaming, sure I&#8217;ve been told about it, but wow it&#8217;s awesome once youa ctually try. <a href=\"http://imperiaonline.org\" target=\"_blank\">This</a> has got to be the best MMORPG I&#8217;ve ever played. It&#8217;s got all the properties of a MMORPG, except perhaps for an active environment, but in the mean time it&#8217;s lacking all of the bad properties. It doesn&#8217;t eat up all of your time and it certainly doesn&#8217;t glue you to the computer screen for hours on end. On top of that <a href=\"http://imperiaonline.org\" target=\"_blank\">Imperia Online</a> has very nice hand drawn images that are simply marvelous to look at.</p>\n<p>Another great discovery was <a href=\"http://www.cartoontomb.de/english/death.php\" target=\"_blank\">Death &amp; Maiden</a> a very funny webcomic that speaks of Death being quite the interesting and complex character that is getting cheated by a mere girly. The first part was great, sadly it&#8217;s finished already, and the second part is showing great promise, although it&#8217;s made in a somewhat different naration style. So guess we&#8217;ll see&#8230;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bbc352a5-09a8-500b-bd2e-17548fb10fc3"}}
