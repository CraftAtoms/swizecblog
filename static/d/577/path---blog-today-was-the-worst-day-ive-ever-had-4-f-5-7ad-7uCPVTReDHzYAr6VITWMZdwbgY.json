Nothing spectacular happened, just a bunch of small very very irritating and annoying things, just enough to ruin your mood for a whole week.</p>\n<p>Which is awesome since it&#8217;s Monday.</p>\n<p>Even better, I&#8217;m going to <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/london\" title=\"London\" rel=\"geolocation\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5080555556,-0.124722222222&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=51.5080555556,-0.124722222222 (London)&amp;t=h\">London</a> tomorrow and am expected to be all chirpy and awesome.</p>\n<p>Because the day can speak for itself, I&#8217;m just going to list everything:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I got up quite a bit later than I intended.</li>\n<li>It was cold and incredibly humid outside.</li>\n<li>By the time I got to uni to have a grade officially noted down, I was dripping sweat.</li>\n<li>Went to hackerspace to study, made tea.</li>\n<li>10 minutes later realised I&#8217;d forgotten my calculator at home, went get it.</li>\n<li>Dripping sweat when got home.</li>\n<li>This time get in car and go back to hackerspace.</li>\n<li>Going for calculator took an hour. Made new tea.</li>\n<li>Ten minutes later classmates called, let&#8217;s go study at a random open classroom.</li>\n<li>It is now almost noon and I&#8217;ve only had a few sips of tea.</li>\n<li>All vending machines at the faculty are out of energy drinks, everyone&#8217;s studying.</li>\n<li>With the last change I&#8217;ve got I grab a coke.</li>\n<li>At 3pm the exam starts and it&#8217;s a fucking assrape. I literally felt the professor&#8217;s dick go up my arse when I put my eyes on the problem.</li>\n<li>Struggle through somewhat solving everything.</li>\n<li>It took so long I couldn&#8217;t pick a time/date to go get my grade. Got one that is on a day when I&#8217;m in London.</li>\n<li>Go back to hackerspace to mostly hang out, do some business stuff.</li>\n<li>Laptop runs out of disk. Quickly empty trash.</li>\n<li>Emptying trash takes two hours.</li>\n<li>While emptying trash the only data file for my time logging app where I log pretty much everything I do so I can have an oversee of what I&#8217;m doing with my time &#8230; goes missing.</li>\n<li>Fine I&#8217;ll just restore it from backups.</li>\n<li>Mate beats me in almost every single game of Guitar Hero.</li>\n<li>Get home, start restoring that file from backups.</li>\n<li>Find out someone had turned Time Machine off on December 6th 2009.</li>\n<li>Give up. The day is officially horrible. The only way it could get worse is if I magically break my leg while sleeping.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=940b47df-4429-48c5-bd5d-5a6a9ce36151\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1c142356-b4f8-50c0-9915-aafcf11e35da"}}
