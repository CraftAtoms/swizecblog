An app that gives perspective to your life. Oh, you don&#8217;t have time to read a book? Well, you spent 5 hours on Twitter yesterday. Are you sure?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wish there was an app to put &quot;I don&#39;t have enough time&quot; or &quot;this costs too much money&quot; into perspective.</p>\n<p>Example: </p>\n<p>Me: I don&#39;t have enough time to read books.<br />App: You wasted 29 hours on Twitter this week.</p>\n<p>Me: 16$ is too much for this book.<br />App: You ate a fucking 25$ burger.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Kitze (@thekitze) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thekitze/status/931948509472927744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 18, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>For the MVP, I envisioned a form where you fill out what you don&#8217;t have time or money for, ask for some perspective, and the webapp delivers. It doesn&#8217;t deliver yet because I decided to build it in <a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a>.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7934\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-09.16.40.png\" width=\"1133\" height=\"715\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-09.16.40.png 1133w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-09.16.40-300x189.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-09.16.40-768x485.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-20-at-09.16.40-1024x646.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1133px) 100vw, 1133px\" />\n<p>You can see some of my initial struggles with Vue in the video above. In a few bullet points ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Vue&#8217;s onboarding experience feels like a warm hug. You&#8217;re immediately showered in community support, example projects, and helpful resources. </li>\n<li>vue-cli is more accommodating to different preferences than create-react-app. It asks questions and tries to configure itself for a good experience.</li>\n<li>The default ESLint config that comes with vue-cli is woefully incompatible with my Prettier config. That was painful. I wish it came with a <code>.prettierrc</code> file so it would configure my autoformatter to the settings it expects.</li>\n<li>Throwing linting errors instead of warnings by default feels a little forceful. I had to re-make my project from scratch without ESLint.</li>\n<li>Choosing the right VSCode extension to get Vue supportâ€¦ well, there are a lot of them. I ended up going with the Vue Extension Pack. I don&#8217;t know everything that it did for me, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll need it eventually.</li>\n<li>Out-of-the-box support for end-to-end testing with Nightwatch is ðŸ‘Œ</li>\n<li>The Vue coding experience itselfâ€¦ I think I need to give it more time. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Vue feels like a bastard child between React 13 and Angular 1. I love that it uses and promotes components. That&#8217;s how it should be. I like that it tries to conform to the web-components standard. It&#8217;s a good standard, and this will help it come about quicker.</p>\n<p>I hate the Angular 1 style <code>v-if</code> and <code>v-for</code> stuff where you shove a bunch of complex logic into your templates. I know this is hypocritical coming from the React world where we shove our templates into JavaScript, but somehow that feels more elegant.</p>\n<p>Yes, the React approach does lead to some horrendous code when people put too much logic into their JSX.</p>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s all about programmer discipline to avoid mixing presentation with logic too much.</p>\n<p>And yet, I still feel like it&#8217;s more elegant to treat HTML as a first-class citizen in your JavaScript than to treat JavaScript as a 2nd class citizen in your HTML.</p>\n<p>With React, it feels like my JavaScript directly manipulates what&#8217;s on the screen. I&#8217;m building a UI and have direct control of what&#8217;s being shown to the user. I can assign pieces of the UI to different variables, treat them as Just Dataâ„¢, and generally have fun and feel in control.</p>\n<p>Vue, on the other hand, enforces an artificial separation of concerns that I don&#8217;t think is useful. I&#8217;m still building a UI and manipulating what&#8217;s on the screen, but it feels removed. Like trying to tie a knot with 10 foot tweezers instead of your fingers.</p>\n<p>With React, I can reach in and get dirty. With Vue, my dandy little hands never touch anything real.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what it feels like anyway. <em>shrug</em></p>\n<p>And the syntax for building components feels strange too. Very React 13 where we didn&#8217;t have proper JavaScript class or function support yet.</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\nexport default {\n    name: \"MyComponent\"\n    data() {\n        return {\n            data1: \"\",\n            data2: \"\"\n        }\n    },\n    methods: {\n        doThing() {\n        },\n     \n        onClick() {\n        }\n    },\n    components: {\n        ChildComponent\n        AnotherChild\n    }\n}\n</pre>\n<p>o.O</p>\n<p>That, to me, looks weird. Where are all the advances we&#8217;ve made in JavaScript over the past few years?</p>\n<p>Why am I defining child <code>components</code> with an object, internal state, called <code>data</code>, with a function, and a list of <code>methods</code> as what looks almost like a class but isn&#8217;t quite? Feels weird.</p>\n<p>I like the React approach where you have a JavaScript class. Its methods are its methods, its props can be state, there&#8217;s a <code>.state</code> variable which is the proper connected state, and children are automagically defined by being nested in the component. You know, just like in normal HTML.</p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be weird if in HTML you had to declare all the children you&#8217;re going to use in a certain element?</p>\n<p>So far I am more weirded out than impressed. Perhaps with time Vue will grow on me.</p>\n<p>ðŸ¤“</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0c34e5ab-77ff-55fd-a910-35cefa3bf98b"}}
