{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"My barcamp Ljubljana report","content":"<p><a href=\"http://www.barcamp.si/\" target=\"_blank\">Barcamp Ljubljana</a> happened yesterday and if you don&#8217;t know what a barcamp is don&#8217;t go looking for explanations in this post. I still can&#8217;t explain what a barcamp is, it&#8217;s just one of those difficult to epxlain things, like twitter or open source,but I can vouch for them being EXTREMELY fun. No Saturday before had ever flown by so quickly. So yes, I am extremely pleased that I went.</p>\n<p>We started off in the morning, me wisely coming much earlier than I usually would to something like this (in the words of one Henry Wotton, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time to be punctual&#8221;) because I wanted to have a presentation and I&#8217;ve read that the earlier you get there the more slots are left for you to pick from. So I picked a spot at a lovely time in a lovably small classroom &#8230; but they later on moved me into the big lecture hall sine I apparently piqued a lot of people&#8217;s interests. Err thanks guys, I was totally unprepared, a complete newbie never having given a public presentation before and you go and move me to the big lecture hall. Brilliant.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, all the talks I was to were quite awesome. Must say I found Andraz Tori&#8217;s introduction into gaining investments for an idea especially intriguing and I think everyone there really got a lot from the whole thing. The other pearl amongst talks was somebody&#8217;s talk, sorry I forgot the name of the very cool guy, on data mining. He should work as an actor, it was magnificent to watch.</p>\n<p>The best thing about barcamps, judging from yesterday&#8217;s, is that so many great people were there and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever before gotten to know so many new people in a single day. Especially at the party afterwards, wow, hope I didn&#8217;t make an arse of myself though &#8217;cause the last thing I remember was talking to <a href=\"http://twitter.com/gandalfar\" target=\"_blank\">@gandalfar</a> about &#8230; err what were we talking about again &#8230; oh well. I&#8217;m sure the important bits will come to me eventually.</p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t wait to go to another barcamp.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ddcdddd5-09f7-5739-95b4-fa85ffb99982"}}
