{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"$2535 November sidehustle report","content":"<p>You know how <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/16661-october-sidehustle-report/swizec/7883\">last month</a> was huge and money rained from the sky? November, not so much.</p>\n<p>Didn&#8217;t even break even.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s one of the main surprises for my friends about running a business. They see a report like last month&#8217;s and their eyes go wide and they whisper amongst each other and crack jokes about how much money I have. They ignore the other reports.</p>\n<p>What they forget is that a spike is not a trend. It can indicate a trend, but it rarely means you&#8217;re going to be making that much or more from now until eternity.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Screen-Shot-2017-12-03-at-11.06.58.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>November was bad. Sure, there was a lot going on, attempts were made, but ultimately not much happened. Running a sale like my 30-at-30 promotion is like frontloading your customers.</p>\n<p>You get an infusion of money now and it&#8217;s great, but those people from your audience aren&#8217;t going to be ready to buy anything else for a while. So instead of a trickle of sales every week for the next few months, you compact all those future sales into <em>now</em>.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s kinda what happened. Going to take a while for regular sales to rebound. Gonna need to develop some new products too.</p>\n<p>Like that Intro to React and Redux video course I promised. Working on it ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>You may also have noticed that I haven&#8217;t been publishing as much in November. That&#8217;s because I was working on a lot of things that are going to show up in December&#8217;s report.</p>\n<p>Some stuff I can&#8217;t talk about yet, other stuff you&#8217;ve likely already seen. Like the <a href=\"https://bestjavascript.io\">JS Bundle</a> we put out with a bunch of other authors.</p>\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t seen that, then our marketing sucks.</p>\n<p>Actuallyâ€¦ I&#8217;m gonna have some thoughts on that soonish ðŸ¤” Because it did not go as well as I&#8217;d hoped ðŸ˜…</p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s November in numbers ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<p><strong>Total revenue</strong> $2249</p>\n<p><strong>Gumroad sales</strong> $1309<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js\">React   D3v4</a>: $1272<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"https://es2017.io\">JS cheatsheet &#8211; es2017</a>: $37</p>\n<p><strong>Leanpub sales</strong> $392<br />\n&#8211; React   D3v4: $348<br />\n&#8211; React   D3 old versions: $25<br />\n&#8211; <a href=\"http://nightowlsbook.com\">Why Programmers work at Night</a></p>\n<p><strong>Patreon pledges</strong> $211</p>\n<p><strong>Educative</strong> $274<br />\n&#8211; React   D3v4 course: $274</p>\n<p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 78 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Expenses â†’</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editor: $500</li>\n<li>VA: $400</li>\n<li>Facebook ads: $985</li>\n<li>Twitter ads: $600</li>\n<li>Reddit ads: $36</li>\n<li>Drip: $149</li>\n<li>SumoMe: $99</li>\n<li>Webfaction: $10</li>\n<li>LiveEdu Pro: $10</li>\n<li>AWS: $14</li>\n<li>now.sh: $15</li>\n<li>bestjavascript.io domain: $46</li>\n<li>domainsquatting for ES6  domains: $149</li>\n<li>SmartBribe: $35</li>\n<li>mailchimp: $20</li>\n<li>MicroConf April ticket: $918</li>\n<li>DJI Spark: $649</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Effective hourly rate:</strong> -$44/hour ðŸ˜‚</p>\n<p>Okay okay, the accounting for this month is weird. The DJI Spark will serve me for months if not years. Real accountants look at things like that using something called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization\">amortization</a>.</p>\n<p>You say <em>&#8220;Okay, this cost $649 and has an effective lifespan of 24 months. Therefore, it costs $27/month&#8221;</em>. But I&#8217;m lazy so I make that calculation in my head to decide if buying something is worth it, then put it in my reports as a one-time cost.</p>\n<p>It all evens out in the end. As long as the average trend across months is up ðŸ“ˆ I&#8217;m okay.</p>\n<p>PS: The hella expensive ads were for the JS Bundle, the revenue of which comes next month.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"01962277-bf3a-54f3-bdb6-b22a76f4ab65"}}
