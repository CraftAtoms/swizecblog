Writing for yourself just wouldn&#8217;t feel the same if it was done privately in a random notebook would it?</p>\n<p>Sometimes I manage to get a couple of thousand people to come upon a blogpost I have written and &#8230; then what?<!--more--></p>\n<p>Problem is that the usual analytics tools only count hits. That is, how many people came onto your blog. Recently <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Analytics\" href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\" rel=\"homepage\">Google Analytics</a> started changing that a little bit by also counting how many users perform some sort of social action. This is a pretty good measure of how good people think your post was, or even simply how interesting it seemed.</p>\n<p>However, that&#8217;s only a small part of what I care about. I want to learn how good a writer I am, how well do I captivate a reader and keep them reading? Surely the most important mark of a good post is how many people <em>actually read it!</em></p>\n<h2>Enter <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mixpanel\" href=\"http://www.mixpanel.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Mixpanel</a>, stage left.</h2>\n<p>With this in mind <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1222278\" target=\"_blank\">I set up a simple javascript</a> that sends an event to Mixpanel every time somebody scrolls past a paragraph of text. To this day I have never actually taken the time to look at this data, but at the beginning of this month I wrote a <em>very</em> lengthy blogpost.</p>\n<p>1700-ish words, 58 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Paragraph\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph\" rel=\"wikipedia\">paragraphs</a> <em>long</em>.</p>\n<p>That post received 3445 hits, 5 G+, 38 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"homepage\">tweets</a> and 3 facebook likes.</p>\n<p>EDIT: The post was &#8220;<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-went-through-yc-as-an-intern-heres-what-i-learned/swizec/2345\">I went through YC as an intern, here&#8217;s what I learned</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Right, not a total throwaway post. People actually liked it! Yay!</p>\n<p>But here&#8217;s where it gets interesting. Out of all those people only 574 made it to the end. Somewhere in all that text I lost over 80% of my readers!</p>\n<p>Wow, that can&#8217;t mean anything good for my writing skills. 1700 words is about five pages in a standard book format. Now imagine if I was writing an actual book &#8230; <em>nobody</em> would make it to the end!</p>\n<h2>Bleeding readers like a boss</h2>\n<p>Looking at the data in more detail it looks like only 80% of the users read the first ten paragraphs, and 70% read the first 20 paragraphs. Not too bad at all.</p>\n<p>Then something strange happened in this particular post, only 41% of the readers made it to the 22nd paragraph. This happens to be right next to the photo of some drawings on a shower wall and the title of this section is &#8220;Work hard, party harder&#8221; &#8230; I guess people don&#8217;t like partying and showers?</p>\n<p>After that it settles down, takes another 20 paragraphs to lose another 10% of readers. And another jump, plomps down to just 23% readers making it to the 40th paragraph. This is around the spot where I say that being only an employee in a startup is much easier than being a founder. I guess people don&#8217;t like hearing that either?</p>\n<p>There are no more significant jumps after that, but just over 15% of the readers made it all the way to the end and for that, I thank you awesome 574 people who decided my blog was worth reading through to completion.</p>\n<p>Although interestingly enough, outside those jumps (yes I checked, other posts ending at those paragraphs doesn&#8217;t account for the jumps) on most paragraphs more than 96% of users make it from one paragraph to the next.</p>\n<p>Had another hit on the 3rd of August. The data there is much more level, with 33% of readers making it to the end of a 30 paragraph post. But interestingly enough, only 61% made it from first to second paragraph!</p>\n<p>I think I need to start experimenting with this in a more organized manner. Got my baseline, about a third of my readers make it to the end of a normal length post. Now it&#8217;s time to figure out how to increase that.</p>\n<p>PS: if you&#8217;re interested in the JavaScript that makes this magic happen, just check out <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/1222278\" target=\"_blank\">the source</a>.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blazingminds.co.uk/keeping-content-focused/\">Keeping the Content Focused&#8230; Or Not</a> (blazingminds.co.uk)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://michcommunication.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/the-long-and-the-short-of-it-does-size-really-matter/\">The long and the short of it: does size really matter?</a> (michcommunication.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.convonix.com/blog/social-media-marketing/social-media-blog\">Optimizing Blog Posts for social media</a> (convonix.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.problogger.net/archives/2011/09/13/my-secret-formula-for-creating-super-engaging-blog-content/\">My Secret Formula for Creating Super-engaging Blog Content</a> (problogger.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jenswritingdesk.com/2011/09/12/how-to-make-your-writing-sleek-and-smooth/\">How to Make Your Writing Sleek and Smooth</a> (jenswritingdesk.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.prnewswire.com/2011/07/13/seven-tips-for-better-writing/\">Seven Tips for Better Writing</a> (prnewswire.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=3ed92513-c300-4857-b404-d689d4d082f3\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5eec0352-c446-5e7d-93d5-66123e6cd42b"}}
