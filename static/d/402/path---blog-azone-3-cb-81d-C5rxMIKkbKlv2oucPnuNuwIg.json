{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Azone","content":"<p>\n     On Monday I went to a little place called Prebold in order to see one of the early performances of the band called Azone. I&#39;m told it&#39;s the first with this lineup &#8230; after just five rehersals. Good on them I guess.\n</p>\n<p>\n     The band claims their playing was terrible, that it was slow, full of mistakes and downright rotten. But I guess that&#39;s for them to know, personally I found it enjoyable and really good. Maybe because I&#39;ve not heard their playing properly? Who could tell really.\n</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n<a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/7280946@N06/481113294/in/set-72157600167409474/\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/232/481113294_473886ef41_m.jpg\" border=\"0\" title=\"border=\" /></a></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a7cfc460-ac2d-53d8-9b48-90f7893b19fa"}}
