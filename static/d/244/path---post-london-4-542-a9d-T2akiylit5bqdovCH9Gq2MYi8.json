{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"London 4","content":"<p>\nHaven&#39;t posted in a few days due to a minor case of writer&#39;s block. It happens, can&#39;t predict it, can&#39;t prevent it and it might&#39;ve had something to do with yesterday&#39;s equinox.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo about what I&#39;m going to post tonight, it&#39;s a bit scary and perhaps a bit daunting, maybe with a flare of sparkling funny and almost certainly without any great merit. It is to be about food. So far I&#39;ve only had a few brushes with english cuisine and they were all quite marvelous.\n</p>\n<p>\nPub food is probably the cheapest per amount of food you can get around here. The meals are bloody huge and whatever you order you have to remember that you&#39;ll get a bunch of chips to go along with it. Similar to how you get a huge fucking bowl of rice with anything chinese you order anywhere. Another brush with destiny was fish and chips, which I find to be too glorified. We&#39;ve been eating such stuff at home since I can remember and it isn&#39;t anything too english.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe service, however, anywhere in London, save for the priciest of locations of course, is rather interestingly spun to what I&#39;m used to. Everywhere they make you go up to the bar, order, pay and get your stuff; with food you sometimes wait for a bit and get it served to your table. But in general they make you take your own stuff to the table, much like fast food places and clubs. It&#39;s somewhat disapointing, but oh so London.\n</p>\n<p>\nI am appaled, however, that there is no bloody cafe in this town, that I could find, that can serve tea as tea is supposed to be served. And this is supposed to be a bloody tea country.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4fc247ec-096b-5bc0-a858-ffa859f33bc5"}}
