No idea what I&#8217;d use it for, but it seemed <em>so cool</em>. All those action shots of professional athletes flooding the internets whetted my appetite.</p>\n<p>And now it&#8217;s mine. It&#8217;s finally mine! Mwahahaha.</p>\n<p>As a responsible adult I waited for the right moment to buy the new toy. They aren&#8217;t expensive, but at $300 for the mid-range version, they aren&#8217;t super cheap either. Of course, in Slovenia the same package costs about 400 euro, so currently being in the US helped a lot.</p>\n<p>I bought the GoPro for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I wanted to take cool shots of last Sunday&#8217;s paintball game between everyone at <a href=\"http://www.dwellers.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Dwellers</a>. But I didn&#8217;t because there was nowhere to mount the camera.</li>\n<li>August Longboard Roadtrip. Need I say more?</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"GoPro in the case\" alt=\"GoPro in the case\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DzshyNYLTSuLpbogx4Pz\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">GoPro in the case</p></div>\n<p>After a few days I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>\n<p>Stuck a mount on my helmet, connected my phone to the camera, and went for a cruise around Stanford and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Menlo Park, California\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.4541666667,-122.178611111&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.4541666667,-122.178611111 (Menlo%20Park%2C%20California)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Menlo Park</a> to &#8220;make a video of the area for my friends and family back home&#8221;. Bollocks, just wanted to play with the toy!</p>\n<p>But the video turned out great. If way too long.</p>\n<p>It was dusky when I went out, but the 170 degree angle and fancy camera settings I will never understand made the video even brighter than reality. Since when don&#8217;t cameras need obscene amounts of light to make quality video anymore?</p>\n<p>Despite its size the camera feels surprisingly heavy on the helmet. Then again, it <em>is</em> encased in a waterproof shell that will withstand practically any impact you throw at it. <em>And</em> you can still click all the buttons!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"GoPro case\" alt=\"GoPro case\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/MF5hp8fvTr6LEmBL7QzR\" width=\"384\" height=\"514\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">GoPro case</p></div>\n<p>But my favorite feature is the wi-fi. The GoPro can create a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hotspot (Wi-Fi)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotspot_%28Wi-Fi%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">wi-fi hotspot</a> that you connect to with your phone and use an app to control the camera.</p>\n<p>You can see the preview &#8211; there&#8217;s even a delay that makes it useful when the camera is on your head &#8211; turn on recording, adjust all the strange settings and turn the camera on and off.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s even a feature that makes the camera beep so you can find it when it jumps off your head and into some bushes after a gnarly crash.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"in-app camera preview\" alt=\"in-app camera preview\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/H01uRWFvQOCiZcwVOCmX\" width=\"384\" height=\"576\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">in-app camera preview</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 394px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"App mode switching\" alt=\"App mode switching\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/kSkBnDGSueVlvYfWbXrg\" width=\"384\" height=\"576\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">App mode switching</p></div>\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to see the two videos I made of Stanford, they&#8217;re long and boring, so here&#8217;s a video of me falling on a hill near <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"PARC (company)\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.403,-122.149&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=37.403,-122.149 (PARC%20%28company%29)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Xerox Parc</a> and chasing the longboard down the hill when it ran away.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/XWULrophiEk\" height=\"360\" width=\"640\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=0b0c9eda-ad42-4f5a-8688-318ce1f84f3e\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5cd73c44-cc29-562b-ae4e-146ce7483b90"}}
