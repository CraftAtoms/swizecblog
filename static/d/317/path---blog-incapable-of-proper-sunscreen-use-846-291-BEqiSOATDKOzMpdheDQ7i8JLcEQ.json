I even got to see a wench or two in a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Bikini\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikini\">bikini</a>! Score!</p>\n<p>I should perhaps note that I was surprised at the amount of old and wrinkly people <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Sun tanning\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_tanning\">sunbathing</a> in incredibly skimpy outfits and the immense lack of young wenches doing similar without their tops. Why is it only old and wrinkly women with saggy bosoms dare expose their treasures to the sun adn those actually worth exposure remain neatly tucked away at all times?</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong though, there were only two attractive lasses I saw all day, one was of course my girlfriend, and the other was &#8230; someone, no idea really who it was, but she was hot and I reckon very much taken considering the kind of people she hung out with.</p>\n<p>Yes of course, there was a lot of young unfat flesh out there dressed skimpily, but unfortunately that&#8217;s far from enough to make a girl attractive. It takes a certain amount of attitude </p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1c8dcc03-2f50-5955-9a88-489a7b07e905"}}
