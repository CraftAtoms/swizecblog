Only three states met the deadline and of those one said <em>&#8220;Fuck this, everyone, chill. The law is here, but you have like a year to comply. All&#8217;s good.&#8221;</em>. That was the UK.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t find a source saying which of the 27 EU countries have passed the cookie law, but on June 15th <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Slovenia\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.05,14.5&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=46.05,14.5 (Slovenia)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">Slovenia</a> has become one of those countries annoying its internet users. This affects me. I don&#8217;t like that.</p>\n<p>First thing I heard on the morning of the 16th was my mum rushing into my room <em>&#8220;OMG, what is this cookie thing? Chrome is trying to install a cookie? What the hell is going on?&#8221;</em></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Oh god.

Nobody.</p>\n<h2>Peeshkot</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 138px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/peeshkot/idfkeeahcifaocjonphgjmpmmfonahle\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Peeshkot icon by @ponywithhiccups\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/p0gQmwoMRbqgjKkogBwN\" alt=\"Peeshkot icon by @ponywithhiccups\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Peeshkot icon by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups\">@ponywithhiccups</a></p></div>\n<p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eewan\">@eewan</a> and I made a solution &#8211; <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/peeshkot/idfkeeahcifaocjonphgjmpmmfonahle\">Peeshkot</a>. Instal Peeshkot extension in your <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Chrome\" href=\"http://https://www.google.com/chrome\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome browser</a> and all cookie notices will be gone.</p>\n<p>It will recognise most common implementations and make them go away, or opt-in if necessary. @eewan even made sure it will recognise most homegrown implementations with the use of some clever heuristics.</p>\n<p>Especially recommended for your parents and grandparents and people with short tempers in regards to popups and flashing things.</p>\n<p>We plan to add opt-out support in the near future. Although why you wouldn&#8217;t just block third party cookies if you want that sort of thing is beyond me.</p>\n<p>Did I mention <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/peeshkot/idfkeeahcifaocjonphgjmpmmfonahle\">Peeshkot</a> is open source?
