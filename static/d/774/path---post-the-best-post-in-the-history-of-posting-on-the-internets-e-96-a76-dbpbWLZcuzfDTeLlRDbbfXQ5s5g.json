We could take hundreds of thousands of security guards and police officers around the country off their jobs and put them to more productive use, and we could celebrate our own culture without offending you anymore.</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">Moreover, we could take the three-point shot and the forty-five second shot clock out of basketball which would return it to a game of plays and strategies, instead of the run and gun show our enemies have tailored especially for you. We could place the &#8220;palming penalty&#8221; and the &#8220;walking penalty&#8221; and the &#8220;charging penalty&#8221; back in to slow the game down to the point that defense and brains matter.</div>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\">We could place the &#8220;bump and run&#8221; rule back in football and have referees start calling &#8220;offensive pass interference&#8221; again, to change the game to one where something more than straight-ahead speed is what matters.
