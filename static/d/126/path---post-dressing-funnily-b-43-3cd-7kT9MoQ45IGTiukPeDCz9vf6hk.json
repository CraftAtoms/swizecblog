{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Dressing funnily","content":"<p>\nEver since I was a wee little lad I&#39;ve liked dressing in a quirky, sometimes odd, but always weird-ish fashion. I started out so far ago I can&#39;t even remember when it actually was, but I do know what it was. I love wearing long sleeve sweaters and similar garb with shorts even though everyone knows you&#39;re supposed to go short-sleeved before you move from normal trousers to shorts.\n</p>\n<p>\nLater on, or maybe this was sooner, in preschool I wanted to be put in shirts and ties and such silly nonsense, why I don&#39;t know, but I do know I wanted it and that there exists a photo of me being dressed like that and it is simply magnificent. Later still, when puberty started hitting, I admitedly dropped the ball and started dressing like everyone else. Baggy was the style of choice back then, so I wore everything a few sizes too large, which was only kind of silly, it&#39;d be much better if I didn&#39;t exagerate as much.\n</p>\n<p>\nThen high school came and I decided to start wearing only black, not certain as to why that choice was made anymore, but I do know why I keep upholding it and probably will forever. It&#39;s the simple fact that black is a cool colour. It looks good on me, makes me look slimmer, taller and sexier. Just plain black is boring though, so it&#39;s important to dress in a quirky way to accentuate and make it look better &#8211; colour highlights, also, are a very cool thing.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is why, amongst other reasons, I&#39;ve bought a hat last summer and decided to always keep the monotony broken with a card. The card acts in two ways, one is that it&#39;s a different colour than the rest of me, it breaks up the colour monotony (just as there&#39;s usually something drawn on my t-shirt) and because it&#39;s square whereas the hat is round it also breaks up the hat&#39;s shape, making it look more appealing. People often compliment me on the hat, say that it&#39;s of an awesome shape, things like that, but what they do not realise is that it&#39;s the card doing that, the card is making the hat appear to have some awesome shape whereas in reality it&#39;s just a regular bowler.\n</p>\n<p>\nLast autumn I decided to accesorise even more and bought a very long black scarf. It&#39;s a good thing, I love how far it falls when it isn&#39;t all rolled up and how the ends flail around when I walk. I also love it when I wrap it around twice and it covers my whole neck &#8230; best combination ever is walking around in a t-shirt with a scarf wrapped around your neck. Very good for indoors.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow all I need is a cane. That&#39;s right, a cane. Then my look will be complete for now. After the cane is got I have to start looking into buying more shirts, vests, tailsuits and of course, more hats. A monocle wouldn&#39;t be bad either &#8230;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"70b2503b-9d5e-5889-8b40-6f62eb9823c2"}}
