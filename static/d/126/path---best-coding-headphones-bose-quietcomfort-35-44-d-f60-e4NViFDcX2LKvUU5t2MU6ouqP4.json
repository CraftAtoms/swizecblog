They worked great, made me feel alone in the universe, and were comfortable enough to wear all day. The cable was annoying but okay. It became super annoying after <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/first-day-new-2017-macbook-pro/swizec/7643\">Apple moved their headphone port to the right.</a></p>\n<p>After about 2 years of constant use, my Beats kicked the can.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Confirmed. After about 2.5 years of everyday all day use, my Beats are on their way out. ðŸ˜­</p>\n<p>And I can&#8217;t solder like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m1hah\">@m1hah</a> suggested. <a href=\"https://t.co/lMRelLNbsd\">pic.twitter.com/lMRelLNbsd</a></p>\n<p>â€” Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/885974627180175360\">July 14, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Looking for a replacement, everyone suggested <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E3SNO1G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B01E3SNO1G&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=ageewitahat-20&amp;linkId=e2da7ce562847b54253ae445a5afa79b\">Bose QuietComfort 35</a>. And hot damn were they right! These things are amazing.</p>\n<p>You put them on and the world disappears. You are alone. Think your thinks, code your code. Open office no more. Coworkers don&#8217;t exist. If someone wants your attention they have to get up and come tap you on the shoulder.</p>\n<p>You won&#8217;t know they&#8217;re there and you&#8217;ll do a startle and shit your pants. Worth it.</p>\n<p>I find the padding on the Bose QuietComforts a bit less comfortable than the Beats Studio, but they are a lot lighter. Never realized how heavy my Beats were until I tried these. Bose also packs smaller than Beats which is great. Bulky headphones are a pain in the arse to transport, and at $440 you&#8217;re not gonna have multiple pairs.</p>\n<p><em>You</em> might. Too rich for <em>my</em> blood ðŸ˜…</p>\n<p>Oh and the QuietComfort sound better than Beats. Yes the Beats has more bass and that makes the sound richer, but Bose sounds more real somehow. You listen to a video or a game and it soundsÂ <em>real</em>. Like it&#8217;s not coming out of headphones at all.</p>\n<p>Sometimes I look around in surprise because I can&#8217;t tell if sounds are in real life or in the video. It&#8217;s great.</p>\n<p>Shout at me on Twitter if you think I&#8217;m wrong.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"502fc0e1-1988-5518-8d44-200d886fd468"}}
