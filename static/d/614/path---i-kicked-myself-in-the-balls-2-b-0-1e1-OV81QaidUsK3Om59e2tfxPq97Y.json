Around noon something particularly odd happened though. The week was over. I had finished everything I absolutely had to do, there was no more coursework, no more tasks for this week in pivotaltracker &#8230; nothing.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3116\" style=\"width: 570px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-05-at-12.34.59-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3116\" title=\"The tweet that sealed my fate\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-05-at-12.34.59-PM.png\" alt=\"The tweet that sealed my fate\" width=\"560\" height=\"236\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-05-at-12.34.59-PM.png 560w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Screen-Shot-2011-12-05-at-12.34.59-PM-300x126.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The tweet that sealed my fate</p></div>\n<p>14 hours of pure unadulterated freedom.</p>\n<p>I felt drunk. I didn&#8217;t know how to handle myself. Can&#8217;t even remember the last time I had free time and didn&#8217;t have to worry about everything lurking on the other end.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>A couple of lessons</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Your code is broken, you just don&#8217;t know it yet</li>\n<li>Rejoice about free time and you <em>will</em> jinx it</li>\n<li>Take advantage of free time <em>immediately</em></li>\n<li>Internet Explorer has almost matured into a browser</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But everybody already learned those lessons long ago right?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Having unscheduled time plomped into your lap like this is strange. There are a bunch of things you&#8217;ve been putting off for months that you could do, there&#8217;s that book or three that have been waiting for attention since two summers ago, books you bought a month ago but only read 100 pages of, hell, it&#8217;s sort of sunny outside and maybe you should venture out on that <a href=\"http://instagr.am/p/WeRpv/\" target=\"_blank\">new longboard</a> despite somewhat wet conditions?</p>\n<p>The abundance of choice is truly paralyzing &#8230; until somebody helps out.</p>\n<p>I did end up going for that longboard ride and started working on fixing up some outstanding bugs on my blog, there&#8217;s that mobile mode people have been crying about for months, the footer was broken and I even flirted with a small hack project that&#8217;s been rolling around my head for weeks.</p>\n<p>Not two hours after I set out on the epic fixing of everything that the US woke up and somebody decided to test my code before pushing to production.</p>\n<p>It broke. Three small issues. Just an hour or two to fix surely. Small bug on IE, but I&#8217;m sure I can find a windows box in the apartment somewhere to figure it out &#8230;</p>\n<p>Seven hours, two very deep bugs of which the reported bugs were just symptoms, one very strange django QuerySet behavior and two cups of tea later &#8230; it worked. Everything worked. We pushed to production and I collapsed into bed.</p>\n<p>So much for my free Sunday.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://thedailylongboarder.wordpress.com/2011/09/27/day-4-longboarding-101/\">Day 4 &#8211; Longboarding 101</a> (thedailylongboarder.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.travelpod.com/travel-blog-entries/adambrownell/1/1321987855/tpod.html\">Welcome back to the European Union &#8211; Ljubljana, Slovenia</a> (travelpod.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jezebel.com/5864948/first-grader-kicks-bully-in-the-balls-sparks-sexual-harassment-investigation\">First Grader Kicks Bully In The Balls, Sparks Sexual Harassment Investigation [Kids Today]</a> (jezebel.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.wanderingearl.com/im-in-love-with-ljubljana/\">I&#8217;m In Love With Ljubljana</a> (wanderingearl.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d4491664-5c1e-4068-983b-bf4398ecf699\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"080e1634-890a-536a-b331-f24edc896478"}}
