But that&#8217;s not very interesting.</p>\n<p>A more interesting tale to tell is perhaps how for the last few months I was growing increasingly frustrated with my job, my work environment, my skills toolkit and simply the whole <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"LAMP (software bundle)\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29\">LAMP</a> <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Web development\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development\">web development</a> stack. It was time to take a break &#8230; it was a lot later that I discovered a cool TEDtalk on the topic, watch:<br />\n<object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"446\" height=\"326\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"bgColor\" value=\"#ffffff\" /><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/StefanSagmeister_2009G-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/StefanSagmeister-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=649&amp;introDuration=16500&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=2000&amp;adKeys=talk=stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off;year=2009;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=not_business_as_usual;theme=speaking_at_tedglobal2009;theme=might_you_live_a_great_deal_longer;theme=tales_of_invention;theme=unconventional_explanations;theme=what_makes_us_happy;theme=the_creative_spark;event=TEDGlobal+2009;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#ffffff\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"446\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" flashvars=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/StefanSagmeister_2009G-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/StefanSagmeister-2009G.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=649&amp;introDuration=16500&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=2000&amp;adKeys=talk=stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off;year=2009;theme=new_on_ted_com;theme=not_business_as_usual;theme=speaking_at_tedglobal2009;theme=might_you_live_a_great_deal_longer;theme=tales_of_invention;theme=unconventional_explanations;theme=what_makes_us_happy;theme=the_creative_spark;event=TEDGlobal+2009;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>But anyway, onwards to what I&#8217;d learned.</p>\n<h3>Lessons that can only be learned by staying the fuck away</h3>\n<p>This week my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"PHP\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP\">PHP</a> hiatus saw the beginning of its end, I had to get a freelancing job to pay bills and other such nuissance &#8211; since PHP and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"JavaScript\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\">Javascript</a> seem to be what I&#8217;m most popular for in the community that&#8217;s the easiest thing to get a job for. And to be honest, I&#8217;m not really fluent enough with anything else to do it for real money.</p>\n<p>So earlier this week I had a meeting with the team lead of the project to give me a short tour of their, dare I say it, very well designed framework, and I realised how much extra work needs to be done by the framework just because PHP is such an incredibly lame language.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>PHP doesn&#8217;t have support for that thing where you can use objects right out of a function. So we need a getScalar, getString, getRows, getRow function instead of a lovely getValue, &#8220;&#8221;+getValue(), getRows() and getRows()[0] system. Why php, WHY don&#8217;t you support this?</li>\n<li>PHP also can&#8217;t do inline arrays, objects and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tuple\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple\">tuples</a>. This is great for passing data around in a descriptive way and PHP fails completely. Why can&#8217;t I do a return { x: 0, y: 100 }? Or something like that? It&#8217;s silly that I&#8217;d have to create a whole new Vector class that doesn&#8217;t do anything other than hold two values.</li>\n<li>Another thing PHP desperately needs are <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Named parameter\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter\">keyword arguments</a>, or whatever they&#8217;re called. It should be possible to call a function that has default values and define specific arguments without having to define all the other arguments because the one I need to set happens to be last. Seriously, what if the defaults suddenly change? Do I go through all the code to pass the correct defaults for that one argument I actually need? This could be solved by passing an object around but what&#8217;s this? Objects are a pain to create? Right &#8230;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So I guess that makes for almost one thing I&#8217;ve learned per a month of abstinence. Not the best ratio by all means, but it&#8217;s silly to find that such a modern language used by so many people would be such an utter failure on many points others, not unlike Lisp, have solved half a century ago. What the flying fuck!?</p>\n<p>Did I miss anything? What else does PHP do well and what does it do poorly?</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/f73732bc-0b95-4fab-9868-7484a0ee6556/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=f73732bc-0b95-4fab-9868-7484a0ee6556\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d65bf833-6bfe-53df-8841-b45016fc85ce"}}
