Happy fun times all around.</p>\n<p>Until about like six in the afternoon or whatever the time was when everybody looked like a knackered zombie held together solely by the caffeine molecules in the blood stream. The last presenter I was paying any amount of serious attention to &#8211; Igor Kolar &#8211; even opened his talk with something to the extent of <em>Excuse me when everything goes wrong, but I&#8217;m knackered as hell.</em></p>\n<p>But it was fun, although the insolent bastard who provided only herbal tea should be shot, quartered and hung as a pinnata and beaten with sticks by small children until tea started falling out &#8230; meh we the tea drinkers forgive him, there was still taurin available.</p>\n<p>I put forth a presentation of the <a href=\"http://synapticweb.org/\">Synaptic Web</a>, how we&#8217;re getting there and what it means blahblahblah. Unlike last time I even uttered actual words this time! Victory for all involved! Well &#8230; not completely, there was the small issue of my having been versed in doing pitches lately, which resulted in the talk being bloody too short by a country mile.</p>\n<p>Somehow we fixed that by me blabbing on for a few moments about what Preona is up to and then the whole presentation sort of devolved into a conversation of sorts and we stumbled around the interwebs for a while looking for interesting things and we even watched a video! Yay.</p>\n<p>Now that I think of it, I could&#8217;ve just rolled the video of Khris Loux talking about these things that can be found on <a href=\"http://synapticweb.org/\">synapticweb.org</a>, some other time perhaps.</p>\n<p>Meh it wasn&#8217;t all that bad, we ended up being thrown out and even if the public was less than amused, standing there in front of them and making a fool of myself was damn fun.</p>\n<p>What else &#8230; (the phrased used often during my presentation) &#8230; oh right! We can talk for a bit about the wonderful food that was served. It was wonderful! Omnom!</p>\n<p>And uhm &#8230; well I guess 90% of the people reading this were at webcamp ljubljana anyway so I&#8217;ll just shut up now, here&#8217;s the slides for my presentation.</p>\n<div id=\"__ss_2607382\" style=\"width: 425px; text-align: left;\"><a style=\"font:14px Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif;display:block;margin:12px 0 3px 0;text-decoration:underline;\" title=\"Synapticweb Webcamp 2k9\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Swizec/synapticweb-webcamp-2k9\">Synapticweb Webcamp 2k9</a><object style=\"margin:0px\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=synapticweb-webcamp-2k9-091129101531-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=synapticweb-webcamp-2k9\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed style=\"margin:0px\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"355\" src=\"http://static.slidesharecdn.com/swf/ssplayer2.swf?doc=synapticweb-webcamp-2k9-091129101531-phpapp02&amp;stripped_title=synapticweb-webcamp-2k9\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 11px; font-family: tahoma,arial; height: 26px; padding-top: 2px;\">View more <a style=\"text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/\">presentations</a> from <a style=\"text-decoration:underline;\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/Swizec\">Swizec</a>.</div>\n<div style=\"font-size: 11px; font-family: tahoma,arial; height: 26px; padding-top: 2px;\">PS: the second slide contains a video that slideshare doesn&#8217;t seem to handle too well</div>\n</div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6aa4b08c-52ff-5107-9993-eb6c948afe0f"}}
