There was a bit of activity on twitter as well.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m saying is the post was generally taking off a little bit.</p>\n<p>Then everything went wrong.</p>\n<p>A friend said <em>&#8220;Hey, uhm, I&#8217;m trying to read your blog, but it&#8217;s taking a bit of time to open&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Meh, that sort of stuff happens sometimes. You can never quite pinpoint it and not like I can do anything about it anyway since I have to rush off to class.</p>\n<p>Then the tweets started. <em>&#8220;Hey dude, your blog is down!&#8221; &#8220;LoL, your site just says It works!&#8221;</em> and so on.</p>\n<p>Well &#8230; fuck.</p>\n<p>How could this be? The post wasn&#8217;t even that popular? Somewhere near the bottom of hackernews, nothing but hate from reddit &#8230; impossible!</p>\n<p>Way possible!</p>\n<p>One of the fonts was 404-ing. This results in a request that does not get cached and servers go down. Or rather, servers don&#8217;t go down but one of the lesser sysadmins goes <em>&#8220;You know what, the whole environment is getting a bit slow, and it&#8217;s all due to this guy&#8217;s blog &#8230; I&#8217;m sure nobody will mind if I just shut it down for now.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I minded.</p>\n<p>Then the real fun begins. Later that night the main sysadmin decided that it was finally time to perform that migration to a new server we&#8217;ve been planning for months and he&#8217;ll do it in the morning since he&#8217;s been working on a project &#8217;round the clock and is Too Tired Right Now &#8482;.</p>\n<p>Next morning, joy! Bliss! Heaven! He started, ran rsyinc, I switched around some <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"IP address\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">IP addresses</a> and off we go to greener pastures!</p>\n<p>In a few minutes accessing the raw domain produced a <em><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"HTTP 403\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_403\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">403 error</a></em> and going to /blog gave you a lovely <em>Error establishing database connection.</em></p>\n<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/10229241@N04/1800816503\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Sunday\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2270/1800816503_6147f638fd_m.jpg\" alt=\"Sunday\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sunday (Photo credit: ex.libris)</p></div>\n<p>Progress! The blog is running happily under nginx now and soon enough eveyrthing will be back to normal with just a day&#8217;s worth of traffic gone. Not too shabby really, could&#8217;ve been much worse.</p>\n<p>Then the main sysadmin vanished.</p>\n<p>And I couldn&#8217;t get him back until Sunday.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m just a lowly freeloader with a blog that often brings down whole servers. I don&#8217;t even bring him cake or anything! He has better things to do.</p>\n<p>Finally, on Sunday, rejoicment and glory and heaven and everything that is nice and lovely and sweet. He says <em>Hello, sorry for the delay.</em> on irc and promptly brings the database over to the new server and hooks it up to the wordpress installation.</p>\n<p>Yay my blog is back!</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Okay, everything works, let me just hook up the redirects and page caching back up&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>That was the last I&#8217;ve heard from him. I can only hope it doesn&#8217;t take another week for him to get back to me again. That would suck since this blog is totally vulnerable without a functioning page caching mechanism. There&#8217;s just too much traffic when I post anything remotely interesting.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://mertonmick.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/archie-the-cake-eating-dog/\" target=\"_blank\">Archie the cake eating dog.</a> (mertonmick.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.serverdensity.com/2012/05/06/sysadmin-sunday-78/\" target=\"_blank\">Sysadmin Sunday 78</a> (serverdensity.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://etbe.coker.com.au/2012/04/17/reliable-internet-service/\" target=\"_blank\">The Most Important things for running a Reliable Internet Service</a> (etbe.coker.com.au)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://smallshoptechheavy.wordpress.com/2012/04/16/the-best-laid-plans-of-sysadmins-or-trading-off-capital-vs-labor/\" target=\"_blank\">The Best-Laid Plans of SysAdmins, or Trading Off Capital Vs.
