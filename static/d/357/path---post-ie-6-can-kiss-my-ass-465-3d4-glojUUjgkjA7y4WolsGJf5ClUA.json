{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"IE6 can kiss my ass!","content":"<p>Yet again I&#39;ve been asked to make a site work with IE6 and it&#39;s just fucking stupid that they ask of me to waste that much time on something as stupid. You don&#39;t ask an engineer to make a hydrogen car run on petrol just because petrol is around where people buy the car. You don&#39;t ask an engineer to make a diesel locomotive run on steam just because the owner has a bunch of wood to burn. You don&#39;t ask the whole world to write documents only in notepad because you&#39;re too lazy to install Office.</p>\n<p>For the love of god people, I don&#39;t give a fuck about an OLD browser. There&#39;s a new version and it&#39;s been out for TWO FUCKING years! If you still haven&#39;t bloody updated then it&#39;s your own fucking fault if the internet doesn&#39;t work for you.</p>\n<p>Next time my boss asks me to support IE6 I&#39;m gonna tell them I won&#39;t do it and if they want it done they can just find somebody else to do it. Hell, I could get a better paying, but more stressful and farther away from home, job in a matter of days &#8230; if they don&#39;t like my work, fine.</p>\n<p>They don&#39;t ask the designers to do their designs in MSPaint, so why should I be asked to do my work in an antique? If they (my boss) can go a week using only software from 2k1 and before then I&#39;ll gladly support IE6.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cfd601c2-a4fd-51c4-9987-4ac137015e09"}}
