There are a bunch of people out there right now solving <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23FirstWorldProblems\" target=\"_blank\">#firstworldproblems</a>.</p>\n<p>A waste of talent!</p>\n<p>By being in the same boat I feel like I am betraying my ten year old self who had much bigger plans for me. His ideas on what sort of problems I should be solving was much worthier than what I Â have actually turned out to be working on.</p>\n<p>The main difference between my ten year old self and me is <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Internet\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet\" rel=\"wikipedia\">the internet</a>.</p>\n<p>Back then I didn&#8217;t have it, or rather what I did have was at a friend&#8217;s house on a dial-up line if I asked really nicely. Sometimes even at the library!</p>\n<p>The ideas I had back then might not have been world changing, or they might have been, it&#8217;s hard to say, but the ideas I have right now certainly don&#8217;t seem as grand.</p>\n<p>This leads me to believe that the ideas we have reflect the kind of world we live in.</p>\n<p>Spending a lot of time on the internet makes us see the problems that exist there. And they look like big important problems. But really, when you take a step or two back, they&#8217;re pretty lame ideas that are almost a waste of time to have anyone working on.</p>\n<p>Thus I have decided to go offline for a month, starting tomorrow.</p>\n<p>But because going completely dark would devastate my life, probably make it stop dead (how unlike an addict eh?), I am going to set some ground rules that won&#8217;t ban the internet completely; just make it a bit &#8230; less.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>as a coding reference, the internet is ok</li>\n<li>wikipedia is alright, but keep it down</li>\n<li>I will continue writing my blog</li>\n<li>using <a href=\"http://750words.com\" target=\"_blank\">750words.com</a> every morning is good</li>\n<li>there will be at most an hour every evening of HN/fb/twitter/email</li>\n<li>if something absolutely spectacular happens you are allowed to tweet, no reading outside the hour!</li>\n<li>checking in to foursquare is questionable &#8230; perhaps ban it?</li>\n<li>skype is ok</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To mak sure my slight addiction doesn&#8217;t get in the way I will likely use an <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hosts (file)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">/etc/hosts</a> hack and make sure facebook.com and similar don&#8217;t load outside the allotted hour a day and I will turn off push notifications on everything on my phone. But I <em>will</em> try to rough it at first.</p>\n<p>Right now I have no idea how this experiment will pan out. Most likely I&#8217;ll keep finding some sort of excuse for not doing it or I will break down in tears and cry in a fetal position in the corner. I might even start reading proper books again! That would be awesome.</p>\n<p>Hopefully by the end of the 30 days I will have a less polluted perspective in the world.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck!</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://aldorf.wordpress.com/2011/08/11/dont-fear-the-internet-dot-com/\">Dont Fear The Internet Dot Com</a> (aldorf.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dilbert.com/blog/entry/the_economic_value_of_a_business_startup/\">The Economic Value of a Business Startup</a> (dilbert.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://kellysutton.tumblr.com/post/8930005518/if-our-ideas-seem-smaller-nowadays-its-not\">&#8220;If our ideas seem smaller nowadays, it&#8217;s not because we are dumber than our forebears but because we&#8230;&#8221;</a> (kellysutton.tumblr.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://news.slashdot.org/story/11/08/16/0142226/The-Post-Idea-World\">The Post-Idea World</a> (news.slashdot.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=38f92c98-fc80-48ae-bfcd-99be2ac93f19\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ad24d14a-0bb0-591e-828f-a0f9c5b161a8"}}
