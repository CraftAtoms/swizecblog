{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"30 day fitness experiment with results","content":"<p>Over the last month I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a new fitness routine. Working out for an hour every morning was becoming too bothersome and I wanted to start my days earlier.</p>\n<p>On top of that, I was going to spend <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/a-month-on-the-road/swizec/6317\">a whole month roadtripping around Europe</a> and @robertbasic would strangle me if he had to sit around for an hour while I painstakingly went through a grueling workout regime every morning.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 608px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"The before pic\" alt=\"The before pic\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/514?token=8ggcWKbDpn0xCbP9d7RppQMfo-BTPvl8FwNChfO7If2EDn3ra9Lryjag-SDfWqgueflHIyphJ16sMy3ymyAY99Y\" width=\"598\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The before pic</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When I took that photo I had just spent a month running about 5km on most days of the week and doing one of the two hour-long routines set by <a href=\"http://pumpup.co/\">PumpUp</a> five days of the week. Every day I would do 20 minutes of core circuits and either upper body &#8211; 80 handstand pushups, 200 pushups &#8211; or legs &#8211; 200 lateral lunges, 200 reverse lunges.</p>\n<p>Sure, those numbers are kind of high, but when you break them into four sets with two minutes of rest, the routine becomes very doable. But it takes <em>forever</em>.</p>\n<p>It had also been a month since my last boxing practice. I missed those a lot. They&#8217;re fun.</p>\n<p>At this point I had exactly 60kg, which was 3kg less than the fattest I&#8217;ve gotten this winter. Both the getting bulkier and then slimming down were on purpose. Don&#8217;t you worry about that.</p>\n<p>The new routine was based on two challenges.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/515?token=LzxAjmIXd-svar4vcStvnxgaabGrtc-SOiOw-L4daabPJza5fRnOWGGaU80CGCx5y811yrgyIU31Y8HUk6e7eak\" /> <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/517?token=PpvpFPkIlwv32DXLzm9-y1N_vjVvrwBLYLwAy0-BJTXNVguzibOirIWdltln9hUD0Kg7vOESSYH5Fk3j9NFpZog\" />\n<p>These sorts of &#8220;get ripped in a month&#8221; challenges float around the interwebs and become semi-popular now and then. A lot of people complain it&#8217;s impossible to do 45 pushups or 15 situps without stopping, but it was the perfect starting point for me.</p>\n<p>Obviously I decided to do this routine three times a day. Because if once a day is great, then three times a day can only be greater still, right?</p>\n<p>I also wanted to know if working out three times a day for ten minutes is better than once a day for an hour. It might be, who knows? Worked for <a href=\"http://www.cagepotato.com/check-out-tom-hardys-warrior-workout/\">Tom Hardy when he was getting buff for Warrior</a> &#8230;</p>\n<p>And so I worked out three times a day.</p>\n<p>Before breakfast, around lunchtime or in the evening if lunchtime didn&#8217;t work when we were on the road, and once more around dinnertime or before bed depending on when I did the lunchtime thing.</p>\n<p>It was super easy at first.</p>\n<p>Pumping out some pushups and situps took me less than five minutes and I didn&#8217;t even break a sweat. The final days got up to ten minutes of super grueling stuff that would leave me laying in a puddle of my own sweat.</p>\n<p>Mmmmm &#8230;</p>\n<p>But it was fun. I can <em>feel</em> that my abs are much stronger than they used to be. If light hits them just right, they even look a more defined. My triceps became legend.</p>\n<p>I even added five rounds of three minute shadow boxing with 3lbs weights to the morning workout. It&#8217;s fun and I wanted to keep my boxing shape as much as possible.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 608px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"The after pic\" alt=\"The after pic\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/518?token=bpcB0PUv243Pz6c3HuRQLfwf-ONo1wEJ7MOTVVvIO052BWRiZd3x9RCzQMg-U30U72zfaHIwq_OEqWTp48_KkxM\" width=\"598\" height=\"800\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The after pic</p></div>\n<p>But alas, there is less of me. Much less.</p>\n<p>The after photo is from yesterday morning. Officially a week after both 30 day challenges concluded, but I kept on doing the same thing they&#8217;d set for the last day.</p>\n<p>Even though I can now pump out a hundred pushups, my chest muscles just sort of aren&#8217;t there anymore. My abs don&#8217;t look like they have much more definition either, but a lot of that is probably the lighting. I promise I can see a small difference!</p>\n<p>At this point I had lost 2kg to the fact that I didn&#8217;t track my calories very well on the roadtrip and ended up just eating what I felt like. But my fat percentage was 14.25% when I got back, which isn&#8217;t too bad.</p>\n<p>Just wish I&#8217;d thought of measuring it before I went on the roadtrip. Have to start keeping track of that because apparently I have to get down to 8% if I want that sixpack.</p>\n<p>And I didn&#8217;t keep much of my boxing shape either. Both times I went to boxing practice this week I felt like death afterwards.</p>\n<p>Next step is going back to PumpUp and setting it to three ten minute workouts. See what happens. Should be especially fun on the days I also have boxing &#8230;</p>\n<p>Here is a gif of me shadow boxing. I&#8217;m not a cat but I do have wobbly hair.</p>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/519?token=wPWxBIF3xp4sWBkiRQkuFIxLDJr50SoikEwyVwEqQfksRk7yHDqbi3KpRULVPSokc2ta0ZJ93Nwh6_72uZtzBzk\" />\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"317b2dce-6bc1-5813-bc88-c0acfe72fcae"}}
