Around $55.</p>\n<p>But the margins are different.</p>\n<p>At the day job, I keep about $55 of my $55. Some of it goes to taxes, but it&#8217;s still <em>my</em> salary. From the sidehustle this July, I kept $11 of every $55. Some of which will go for taxes‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>That must be why most people like to have jobs instead of businesses ü§î</p>\n<p>Sometimes I wonder why I even bother‚Ä¶ but then I&#8217;m like, <em>&#8220;Oh yeah, the 100% year over year growth.‚Äù</em> There aren&#8217;t many jobs out there that give you a 100% raise every year I think.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Midpoint of year, sidehustle revenue exactly as much as all of last year. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ontrack?src=hash\">#ontrack</a> üí™üèº</p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/886790354493517824\">July 17, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Anyway, July has been great. I&#8217;m experimenting with a new thing: React/JavaScript coaching. A fan reached out to me asking for help. He&#8217;s been learning how to code on his own for about a year and was getting stuck. Bootcamps went too fast or too slow, random online articles were difficult to piece together, and online courses were great but didn&#8217;t generalize.</p>\n<p>So he asked me for help, and I said sure. The idea was to get him from <em>&#8220;I might be able to code on my own&#8221;</em> to <em>&#8220;Employable engineer&#8221;</em>. Then he got a job at a startup that same week, so I&#8217;ve been helping him with that instead.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s a great coder, probably knows more about JavaScript syntax than I do. But he struggles to take a big hairy problem and break it down into workable pieces. How do you turn a set of fuzzy requirements into specific solutions a computer can run? <em>That&#8217;s</em> the hard part.</p>\n<p>Just as I suspected, most bootcamps and online courses aren&#8217;t great at teaching that. They produce great coders, but not that many engineers.</p>\n<p>Seems like a market opportunity ü§î</p>\n<p>Oh, and I finished <a href=\"https://gum.co/mTWg\">React+D3v4</a>. Editor fixed it up, I tested it all, ready to lock and load.</p>\n<p>The next few weeks are going to be all about launching React+D3v4, then setting up some marketing ideas I&#8217;ve been having. Goal is to have a steady two sales per day average by the end of the year.</p>\n<p>So far it&#8217;s been at 0.6 sales per day average.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/x9dUvCu.jpg\" />\n<hr />\n<p>Here&#8217;s July in numbers üëá</p>\n<p><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $3426</p>\n<p><strong>Gumroad sales:</strong> $970</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React+D3v4: $690</li>\n<li>React+ES6: $277</li>\n<li>ES6 cheatsheet: $3</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Leanpub sales:</strong> $221</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why programmers work at night: $21</li>\n<li>React+d3: $23</li>\n<li>React+D3 ES6: $177</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>React native School:</strong> $1464</p>\n<p><strong>React/JavaScript coaching:</strong> $750</p>\n<p><strong>LiveEdu premium:</strong> $5</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon associates:</strong> $16</p>\n<p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 62 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Expenses:</strong> $2707</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editor: $800</li>\n<li>VA: $468</li>\n<li>Facebook Ads: $244</li>\n<li>Hosting: $10</li>\n<li>Drip: $184</li>\n<li>SumoMe: $99</li>\n<li>Flaticon: $9</li>\n<li>Domains: $33</li>\n<li>Laptop AppleCare: $375</li>\n<li>New Headphones: $375</li>\n<li>CodePen: $75</li>\n<li>SmartBribe: $35</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Hourly rate after expenses:</strong> $11</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s $3 below minimum wage üòÖ</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"75752bc5-78ac-5a8e-98c6-b1715ac3bbc1"}}
