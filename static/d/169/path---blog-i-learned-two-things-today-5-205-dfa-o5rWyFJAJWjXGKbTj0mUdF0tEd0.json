I know this isn&#8217;t the first time I have learned this and that after being stuck in the house for a whole week doing nothing but starting at the screen and producing coloured pixels roughly shaped into instructions a computer might understand as orders &#8230; it&#8217;s almost better than nothing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that the whole thing is inherently bad. There&#8217;s two whole bars you can go partying in!</p>\n<p>But there just isn&#8217;t enough choice and the atmosphere in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Nola\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.9333333333,14.5333333333&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=40.9333333333,14.5333333333 (Nola)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\">Nola</a>&#8216;s and The Old Pro just simply isn&#8217;t my thing. The music kind of sucks, there are too many people cramped into a single space and there is no dancing. When I have to endure a crowd, I want the crowd to at least be dancing to cool music.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I learned is that I am a far far cry from a professional writer still. Writing things on demand simply doesn&#8217;t work for me, or maybe today was a specially bad day for that &#8230; it&#8217;s really difficult to tell with these creative things when you&#8217;re just not good enough to produce on demand and when you just simply need some inspiration, increasing the entropy in your life and so on.</p>\n<p>Should work on that.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/going-from-slovenia-to-palo-alto-what-culture-shock/swizec/1947\">Going from Slovenia to Palo Alto &#8230; what culture shock?</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-29-7/swizec/2022\">I learned two things today 29.7.</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d1bee4c3-f88d-4912-820d-01fc66207d83\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"834626ce-c42b-56dd-882b-f096c720c728"}}
