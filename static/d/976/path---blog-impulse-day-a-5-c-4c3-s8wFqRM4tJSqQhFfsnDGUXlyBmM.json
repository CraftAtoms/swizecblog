{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Impulse day","content":"<p>\n As it would appear today was a very impulsive day as there were many things that occured on pure impulse.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of such things was the idea to go and get some new hair to crown my head with and it really turned out quite well, I like it and it&#39;s a nice, although huge, change. It was done in a true silly person manner as well, when I got there I pulled out a screencap of Depp from Secret Window and said that I wanted that. Promptly enough the hair went from nipple length to just short of chin length.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other thing was an impulse buy of the trashiest of trashy newspapers the country has to offer for the reason of getting a Fawly Towers DVD. Sad part is I got burned and it only contains 3 episodes and those in not too good quality, stupid thing.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0c47ad6d-8e65-5587-85ef-5b7f5a8855ad"}}
