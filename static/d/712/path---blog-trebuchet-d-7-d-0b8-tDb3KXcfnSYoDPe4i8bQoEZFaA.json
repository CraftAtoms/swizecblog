Well, the image above is a link to a collage with crappy photos of the lego trebuchet I built in the last few days and spent quite some time tweaking it today.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n As you can see, it&#39;s not the biggest trebuchet in existence, but it is quite tall and it happens to pack a punch unseen in my room before. The counter weight is right now filled with coins but I&#39;ll probably go buy some fishing lead tomorrow and fill it with that, reckon that will give me a weight of about 2 kilo. The range right now is about 5 meters for a block of four regular 2&#215;4 lego bricks, which appears to be the optimum amunition.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n&nbsp;\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n I stumbled upon a very amusing <a href=\"http://jenwang.net/art/comics/touchfood/\" target=\"_blank\">little comic</a> today, which I think you should go see because well, it&#39;s just awesome.
