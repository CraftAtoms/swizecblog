{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Short penis","content":"<p>\n  Lately I&#39;ve been receiving a lot of emails about my penis being short and ways of fixing the problem. I always wonder just how the hell do they know that I have a small penis? It&#39;s remarkable! Do they make demographic research to find out who has a short weener? Or is there some kind of intricate heuristic algorithm at work?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well no, I probably just managed to post my email address somewhere a certain bot managed to read it, so now I&#39;ve been tagged as a short weener guy (not saying it&#39;s not true). I used to receive a lot more of these a few years ago when my weener was even smaller and then for a few years where I was completely and totally secure about its size there were none. Now that I&#39;m a tad less secure there&#39;s the emails again.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Personally I find that interesting &#8230; that there seems to be a correlation between the amount of spam messages for penis size increase and a person&#39;s security over the size of their member. How the hell!? Well I really canot be certain of how the hell that works, but it still feels as an interesting observation.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Well anyhow, as long as I can pee with it &#8230; you know &#8230; fulfill its basic function and such &#8230;\n</p>\n<p>\n  While on the topic of spam. I keep getting an interesting emotion or whatever it is over seeing students my age, or even older ones, working in this office. The feeling doesn&#39;t stem quite from that, I&#39;m a student working here after all. It comes from the difference in job descriptions. While they create spam envelopes for regular mail or answer the phones, I&#39;m the semi-well paid programmer who gets to be creative and is listened to by the bosses as far as recommendations and such go.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Life is good &#8230; mostly.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"757e8044-1837-56bf-aa1f-7b39aa26f324"}}
