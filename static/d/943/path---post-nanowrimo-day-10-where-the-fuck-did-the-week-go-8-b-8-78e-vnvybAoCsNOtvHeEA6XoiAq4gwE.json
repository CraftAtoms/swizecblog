That there will be some meat on the bones of this story.</p>\n<p>All of this makes me yay!</p>\n<p>What does not make me yay is my complete and utter failure at writing. Despite having to write every day I haven&#8217;t done anything in so long that today when I wanted to do some writing during a break between lectures I &#8230; I &#8230; I forgot where my story was. I completely and totally forgot what I was supposed to write!</p>\n<p>But in any regard, here are the 724 words I managed to muster today, hope you like &#8217;em</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nMoe rushed into class; wet under his nose, shoes pooling with water and the dumbest look on his face ever imaginable. A draft pulled the door from his hand and shut it closed. A deathly quiet filled the lecture hall.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"029f9c17-22ed-59d1-8946-16274a33ea4b"}}
