They&#8217;re long and they hurt and all you get in the end is a cheap piece of metal, a free banana, and some funny gifs. Anyone who tells you that marathons are rewarding and spiritual is a liar.</p>\n<p>Watch my face go from <em>&#8220;Mum thinks you&#8217;re handsome&#8221;</em> to <em>&#8220;Light drug abuse&#8221;</em> in 4 short hours.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/c7a4j\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/c7a4j\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Marathons start early. Or at least the San Francisco Marathon does because they&#8217;re too cheap to keep the course open after 1pm or so.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/1ja4P\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/1ja4P\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>I was late, then I forgot to put on my number, then I had to run to and fro a lot to get it.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/HEFk9\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/HEFk9\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Like, the start of the start line — where my bag was — and the end of the start line — where they let me into my wave — were many blocks apart. 4 blocks. I counted.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/URyrr\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/URyrr\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\nAnd because I was late, it was crowded with slow people. Spent the entire marathon passing everyone and catching up to my intended pacer. I never caught him.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"NrgR0Ez\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/NrgR0Ez\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\n40 minutes in.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/wjDe4\"><p><a href=\"//imgur.com/wjDe4\"></a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script><br />\n1h 20min into it.
