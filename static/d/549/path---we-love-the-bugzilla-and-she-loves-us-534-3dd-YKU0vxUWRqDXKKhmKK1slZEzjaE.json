{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"We love the bugzilla and she loves us","content":"<p>\nA few days ago I instituted a new organisational paradigm for a project at work &#8211; <a href=\"http://bugzilla.org\">bugzilla</a>. This move was done because I was getting slowly fed up with everyone coming straight to me to report what&#39;s not working well, often something I was either already working on or something that was far away from what I was currenlty doing.\n</p>\n<p>\nNaturally a lot of the stuff got forgotten along the road before I could get around to them, I also had no idea how important something was and how much it broke things. This is where bugzilla comes in. It keeps all bug reports in a nice format, organised by priority <em>and</em> I get notified of any new bugs or changes to them via e-mail.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat I love most is the sequental nature of bug displaying. I can just go to the first bug, resolve it and it shows me the next bug I should work on based on priority and some other things I can&#39;t quite fathom. It&#39;s awesome because it gives me a clear &quot;This is what you should do next, do it!&quot; so I don&#39;t have to bother with organising myself and just focuse on the code.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhat I don&#39;t like about bugzilla, however, is that it&#39;s so very obviously made by engineers, for engineers. Worse still, made by bugzilla users for bugzilla users. As a new kid in town it took me quite a while to even figure out how to set things up and teaching my boss to bugreport? HA! I&#39;m lucky he even agreed to using it &#8230; and we&#39;re trying to put the application in a public alpha testing next week where anyone should report bugs they find.\n</p>\n<p>\nLuckily though I&#39;m getting more and more used to bugzilla and was so able to put a link on the front page that lists all bugs &#8211; I think &#8211; and set up a default user with all the login fields already filled in for anyone not wishing to make a special account.\n</p>\n<p>\nNo matter the difficulties, bugzilla will be used with all large-ish projects I work on henceforth.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"301f9c6f-3fc4-57f4-916d-b6cd3c727f5f"}}
