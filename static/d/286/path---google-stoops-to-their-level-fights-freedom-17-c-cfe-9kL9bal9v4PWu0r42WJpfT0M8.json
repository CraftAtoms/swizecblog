{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Google stoops to their level, fights freedom","content":"<p>In my usual fashion I&#8217;m a bit late to discover this bit of news, a day or so late. Naturally I still wanted to share my thoughts on the matter, I mean that&#8217;s what blogging is about, our narcissistic tendencies to shout into the void and see if anyone will hear it.</p>\n<p>Last week an image surfaced on Google Image Search Results of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Michelle Obama\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama\">Michelle Obama</a> photoshopped to look like a monkey. It was first hit even, great SEO guys, you rawk!</p>\n<p>But then a whole lot of backlash started flying in and Google seemed confused and didn&#8217;t know what to do. So they created an apologetic adsense thingy saying something to the extent &#8220;Yeah, these results are sometimes offensive because the internet is one big cesspool of insanity. Fuck it&#8221;</p>\n<p>It was not enough, earlier this week the result was completely removed from any sort of search for &#8220;michelle obama&#8221;. However it can still be found through a bit of a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Streisand effect\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect\">Streissand effect</a> when you search for &#8220;michelle obama monkey&#8221;</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the image:</p>\n<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/michelle-obama-ape.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-905\" title=\"michelle-obama-ape\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/michelle-obama-ape.jpg\" alt=\"michelle-obama-ape\" width=\"356\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/michelle-obama-ape.jpg 356w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/michelle-obama-ape-287x300.jpg 287w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px\" /></a>\n<p>Now, some say this thing is incredibly offensive and goes far beyond political satire just because a black person is involved. Personally I don&#8217;t care, I think it&#8217;s specieist towards monkeys when either a black person or <a href=\"http://doctorbulldog.files.wordpress.com/2009/02/8130george-w-bush-monkey-posters.jpg\">Bush</a> is shooped into a monkey. Nobody seems to care about that though.</p>\n<p>So I ask of you, why is it political satire to shoop a white person into a monkey and a horribly horrible sadistic act of racism when a black person is shooped? Isn&#8217;t making this distinction an act of racism in and of itself thus proving that anyone who actually cares about this matter is in fact a racist?</p>\n<p>For final summation, a very smart man once said &#8220;I may not agree with what you&#8217;re saying, but I will fight to death for your right to say it&#8221;. Apparently said wisdom does not hold anymore on the freest medium of all &#8211; the internets.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/1ad144d6-554e-457c-aaa7-1e2962d4260c/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=1ad144d6-554e-457c-aaa7-1e2962d4260c\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"cff1a586-062d-5b3f-ae80-53a05ccc0cb5"}}
