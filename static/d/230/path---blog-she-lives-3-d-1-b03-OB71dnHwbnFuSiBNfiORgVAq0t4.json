{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"She lives!","content":"<p>\n On Sunday I was finally able to fix my computer after a very long time, I&#39;m not even sure how long anymore and you know, I would&#39;ve posted about it sooner, but I&#39;m both lazy and busy and that&#39;s never a good combination for blogs as they tend to suffer a little.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the computer died I decided the problem  wasin the mother board and a hunt began to find a mother board that supports all of my other antique hardware of three or four years ago. It&#39;s crazy, but there are absolutely no stores that are readily able to provide youw ith a mother board that still has an AGP port and IDE disk connectors.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is just silly! Do they expect me to swap everything from my RAM to my CPU and even disks just so I can buy a new mother board. Damn rabit capitalism and Moore&#39;s law of electronics and it&#39;s all getting quite out of hand if you ask me. Especially for us unrich people, especially for us. Why if anything ever breaks on my computer again I&#39;ll be left with only one option to chuck it out and cast it away like a broken plate nobody wants to look at again.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now here&#39;s the real kicker, I somehow managed to flip the pwoer supply upside-down and point the large 12 centimeter fan at a wall instead of into the computer where it can get air. How? I don&#39;t know.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a48e4f1-8bb2-5d1d-814c-7cfe1893cdc1"}}
