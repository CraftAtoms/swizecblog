Not in terms of physics, but in terms of <em>&#8220;Today I just don&#8217;t have the energy to work.&#8221;</em>, or <em>&#8220;I always get so sleepy after lunch and can&#8217;t get anything done&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Everyone knows their energy levels fluctuate through the day, but that&#8217;s not good enough. For <a href=\"http://leanpub.com/nightowls\">Why programmers work at night</a>, I wanted to find <em>what</em> these mythical energy levels are exactly.</p>\n<p>The term I was looking for was <em>&#8220;mental energy&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Excitement abounds! After days of fussing, I finally know what to search for!</p>\n<p>Giddily I discovered research on mental energy is alive and busy. A lot of articles published in the last few years, all of them looking very relevant to what I&#8217;m interested in.</p>\n<p>But I think scientific <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Publishing\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">publishers</a> don&#8217;t want me to cite <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Research\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">original research</a> in my work. Can anything else explain the ridiculous paywalls they have in place?</p>\n<p>Out of some 20 interesting articles I found, only six had free pdf&#8217;s available online. And of those, only two or three were easily available.</p>\n<p>After numerous citation pages with nothing more than an abstract posted, I have culled my list down to four really great sounding articles with the total cost of $207. <strong>$207 for 4 articles.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00207450802333995\">Sensitivity to Change in Cognitive Performance and Mood Measures of Energy and Fatigue in Response to Differing Doses of Caffeine or Breakfast<br />\n</a> &#8211; <strong>$86 for 19 pages</strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/nns/2007/00000010/f0020005/art00005\">Cognitive methods for assessing mental energy</a> &#8211; <strong>$48 for 14 pages</strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289605000279\">Mental Energy</a> &#8211; <strong>$31 for 4 pages</strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1753-4887.2001.tb06995.x/abstract\">The Effects of Ginseng, Ephedrine, and Caffeine on Cognitive Performance, Mood and Energy</a> &#8211; <strong>$42 for 4 pages</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>$6.5 per page on average.</p>\n<p><em>$6.5 per page</em>!</p>\n<p>I understand these publishers have small sales volumes, but this is beyond ridiculous. Who even buys these things? Universities?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s nice I guess. But I&#8217;m not part of a university. I&#8217;m writing the book independently and on a shoe-string budget. But I am not welcome in the ivory tower of academia.</p>\n<p>Keep this in mind next time you complain about the poor state of scientific reporting in the media.</p>\n<p>Outsiders are not welcome.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=04f6efe8-67bb-4a5c-a4c1-43aac378e077\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2267966a-1010-5285-a270-df96b4e1d4ed"}}
