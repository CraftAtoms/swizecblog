{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Why People Read my Weekly Emails","content":"<p>Last week, I sent this email to 7,118 people:</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7503\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-read-emails-1.png\" width=\"798\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-read-emails-1.png 798w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-read-emails-1-300x239.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/why-read-emails-1-768x612.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 798px) 100vw, 798px\" />\n<p>Scary, but necessary. For a while now, I&#39;ve been feeling my weekly emails aren&#39;t as good as they should be. Open rates are dropping, subscribers are churning almost as fast as they&#39;re coming in‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Not a good place to be. ?</p>\n<p>I mean, just look at this. 36% open rate on the random question, 22% on the weekly email two days later. Not good at all.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7504\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/drip-screenshot.png\" width=\"2646\" height=\"1124\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/drip-screenshot.png 2646w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/drip-screenshot-300x127.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/drip-screenshot-768x326.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/drip-screenshot-1024x435.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2646px) 100vw, 2646px\" />\n<p>Yes, that <em>does</em> list only 5,197 subscribers. It&#39;s because my email list is split between two Drip accounts. The big list is for people who subscribe by buying a product or signing up for a technical course or getting a free book chapter or something like that. A smaller, 2,000-person list is for those who subscribe directly through this blog.</p>\n<p>You could say one list leans towards customers and the other leans towards fans. Open and click-through rates are similar for both lists.</p>\n<p>The lists are split because I thought they were two different types of audiences back when I set it up. They&#39;re not.</p>\n<h2>Here&#39;s what I found out ?</h2>\n<p>77 people hated the question and unsubscribed. That hurt, but it&#39;s only 1%. I guess I&#39;ll live.</p>\n<p>32 people loved it and shared it on Twitter from the <em><a href=\"https://swizec.com/thanks.html\">&quot;Thank you for being awesome&quot;</a></em> page.</p>\n<p>15 people replied.</p>\n<p>3 people complained on Twitter that I only gave them one voting option. This was on purpose to force a decision üôÇ</p>\n<p>500 people clicked a link and voted. That&#39;s amazing. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s the breakdown:</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7505\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breakdown-screenshot.png\" width=\"1694\" height=\"882\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breakdown-screenshot.png 1694w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breakdown-screenshot-300x156.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breakdown-screenshot-768x400.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/breakdown-screenshot-1024x533.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1694px) 100vw, 1694px\" />\n<p>My dreams of becoming the Casey Neistat of JavaScript are dashed. ? People don&#39;t care about my personal shit. They want code and more code. Some care about the business of code.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s okay. I&#39;ve heard rumors that the reason people like my code writings is because I make them personal and approachable. ?</p>\n<p><strong>So how am I going to use this info to make my weekly emails better? </strong></p>\n<p>I&#39;m going to make the emails a lot more personal. I know people said they don&#39;t care, but I think that secretly they do. Every week, there&#39;s going to be a short cover letter that‚Äôs exclusive to the mailing list. This, I think, will improve our relationship.</p>\n<p>And while all three groups are going to get the same content, it&#39;s going to be personalized. For the technical group, the lead story will be technical; for business, the lead will be business; and so on. This, I think, will improve open rates.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m also going to use this to improve people&#39;s onboarding experience. After you subscribe, you&#39;ll get to choose a topic.</p>\n<p>The overall goal is to help people become better engineers. We&#39;ll see if it works üôÇ</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"07e86456-88e1-57de-9607-369825efd20f"}}
