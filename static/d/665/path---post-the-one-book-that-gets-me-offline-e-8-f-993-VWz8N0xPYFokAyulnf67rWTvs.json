I&#8217;ll get to them &#8230; eventually.</p>\n<p>I used to be a voracious reader, going through books as if they were cookies. I still remember being eight or nine years old, waking up at 5am to read a book for two hours before getting ready for school.</p>\n<p>Evenings looked pretty much the same, I&#8217;d go to bed at 9pm and just read. Anything. Everything. Nothing was safe from my reading appetite. <em>Just one more page! Please, mum?</em>Â was my catchphrase.</p>\n<h2>An internet</h2>\n<p>Then I got an internet.</p>\n<p>I was still reading books. Mostly when school forced it upon me. Then I would devour a piece of classical literature in two afternoons. Because, you know, everything is easier at the last minute. And I would <em>enjoy</em>Â the book. Absolutely love it!</p>\n<p>After the deadline &#8230; back to the internet.</p>\n<p>This has gotten progressively worse to the point I simply don&#8217;t allow myself near a bookstore anymore. What&#8217;s the point in buying books if you never find the time to read them?</p>\n<h2>Brain snacking</h2>\n<p>Funny thing is, I&#8217;m still a voracious reader. I probably read, or at least scan, upwards of 50 blog posts every day. Count in all the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com\" rel=\"homepage\">tweets</a>, facebook updates, forum posts, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Internet Relay Chat\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\" rel=\"wikipedia\">IRC</a> conversations and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hacker News\" href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">HackerNews</a>comments and I probably read 50 pages of &#8220;books&#8221; a day.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 190px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/60697241@N00/119923039\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Dark Tower\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/119923039_1333cbbd02_m1.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Tower\" width=\"180\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dark Tower (Photo credit: fridayn)</p></div>\n<p>50 pages.</p>\n<p>Time &#8230; wasted.</p>\n<p>Of all those blogs and comments and tweets and everything, most of it is just interesting. Something to keep my mind occupied. A little candy to keep me happy while I go on about my day.</p>\n<p>Most of it isn&#8217;t even that well written!</p>\n<p>But hey, it&#8217;s always right there. At the tip of my fingers. Something new always coming along to satisfy my voracious appetite for brain food.

He advocates a plain spoken style, people today don&#8217;t have time to read. They don&#8217;t even <em>want</em> to read. You have to shove it down their throats. Tell them a cool story in a simple style and before they know it, they&#8217;ve just read a good book.</p>\n<p>Uh-oh!</p>\n<p>Head trick as Rausch would say. ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>And The Dark Tower is one hell of a story. It reads just like a blog post! None of that high english nonsense, just plain words, lots of swearing, sex and violence. But hiding a very deep and meaningful tale if you care to look for one.</p>\n<p>The real winner is how the story is laid out. There&#8217;s a break every two or three pages. Plenty of chapters. Every chapter almost meaninglessly divided into subchapters.</p>\n<p>Some a third of a page long. Some start in the middle of events.</p>\n<p>Sounds annoying, but it&#8217;s brilliant.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s the biggest obstacle to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Reading (process)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">reading a book</a>? The commitment, before you is a bunch of text and you have to commit to reading all of it. Nobody wants to stop reading mid-sentence because the kettle is boiling.</p>\n<p>Rushing to finish the page so you can keep your place &#8230; just because someone tweeted you and you have to respond.</p>\n<p>The worst part of reading a book is not knowing when the next break is coming and only having an hour of time to read. You might happen upon a break, or you might not. If you do, awesome, if you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;re left with a subconscious sense of guilt that you started something and didn&#8217;t finish.</p>\n<p>With Stephen King that problem doesn&#8217;t exist. You&#8217;re guaranteed to finish <em>something</em>Â every time you pick the book up. Even if you&#8217;re just taking a shit.</p>\n<p>And the best part is, whenever you put the book down, it calls to you. It beckons in your dreams and you <em>want</em>Â to get your arse offline and continue reading. So you <em>will</em>Â go offline andÂ finish the damn book.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.hollywood.com/news/Stephen_King_Dark_Tower_Reborn_at_Warner_Bros/20284768\">Stephen King&#8217;s &#8216;The Dark Tower&#8217; Reborn at Warner Bros.</a> (hollywood.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.aintitcool.com/node/54228\">Is Warner Bros and HBO about to pick up Ron Howard&#8217;s adaptation of The Dark Tower?</a> (aintitcool.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://inspirationlocation.com/2012/03/09/media-fast/\">Media Fast</a> (inspirationlocation.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.thepunch.com.au/articles/if-you-dont-read-books-you-shouldnt-be-writing-one/\">If you don&#8217;t read books you shouldn&#8217;t be writing one</a> (thepunch.com.au)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/210313/Ive-read-a-lot-of-books-Now-I-want-to-do-something-productive\">I&#8217;ve read a lot of books.
