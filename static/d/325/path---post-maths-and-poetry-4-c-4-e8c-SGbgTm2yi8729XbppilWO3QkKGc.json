{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Maths and poetry","content":"<p>\nWhere to begin this blog post that once again is far too late in being written much unlike blogs are supposed to be in that the events I am about to describe happened oh I don&#39;t know, three, four? days ago. On Wednesday. There, now we&#39;re clear on the time frame within which to understand the written words shining through our electronic devices that are some day to be the death of us all.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was a poetry reading contest in a far away place of Maribor on Wednesday and for reasons unknown I had signed up for it a week prior to said event. Needless to say, in my enthusiasm I had completely neglected the fact that I&#39;ve not written a single piece of poetry in about three years; surprise surprise, come the day of terror I had only half of a poem written.\n</p>\n<p>\n But as luck would have it the day was completely free of all obligation so verily I could write some poetry then and have it ready for the contest. Right? Wrong. When my lass came hopping through the door ready for us to leave for a great journey in a few hours I still had only half a poem written. Later she confessed she thought me quite daft, but at the time she mentioned naught. We put our hairy heads together and before you can say &quot;that is one big bug in your buttery toast that is attempting to steal your thunder and eat your toast&quot; or figure out what it means we had two more poems written. In the device of timeleaping frogginess, otherwise known as a car, she managed to write two more.\n</p>\n<p>\n The club wherein the event was taking place was full of strange people and an electricity in the air that made me have terrible stage fright. Oh I&#39;m too late, oh everyone else is so much older, oh I haven&#39;t prepared properly. oh I&#39;m just a hack, oh why do I even fool myself into thinking that I can write &#8230; and things like that. But a few whiskeys later I was all ready and the more I was on stage, the more I loved it. Have I mentioned this was my first time ever being on a stage of any kind?\n</p>\n<p>\n In the end I finished third and received a surprising amount of congratulatory words from everyone in the club. For one reason or another they seemed to have liked me. I can&#39;t understand why. One of them even ventured so far as to say that yeah, the poetry was alright as well. Strange people &#8230;\n</p>\n<p>\n The title is maths and poetry right? Well here&#39;s the maths part. Tomorrow there is a very difficult and terribly daunting maths midterm waiting for me, sorry, analysis, for which I have done nothing more than procrastinate studying and be a generally bad student.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eedb72a8-ff9a-5b58-b2a5-f3ef7c189c47"}}
