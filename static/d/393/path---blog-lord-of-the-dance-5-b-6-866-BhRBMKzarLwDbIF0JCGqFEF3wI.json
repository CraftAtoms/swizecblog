{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Lord of the dance","content":"<p>\nYou know, for the <em>Greatest dance show on Earth</em> Lord of the dance sure was just a bunch of pixies prancing about on stage. Don&#39;t get me wrong, they&#39;re awesome dancers and some of the things they do with their blumin&#39; feet are breath-taking (wonder if their ankles get sore after a while).\n</p>\n<p>\nIn majority the show was a cacophony of sound and visuals, a spectacle, but sadly <strong>just</strong> a spectacle. It was a football match of dance shows, a hockey game, a pop concert. There was much for the <em>oooooo pretty</em> and very little for the mind to find. Whatever story there was, was fully transparent and no better than the majority of bollywood productions. Whatever there was of greatness and <em>aaaaaahhh</em>&#39;s was no better than a hollywood action flick.\n</p>\n<p>\nThere was, however, one redeeming quality to the show. it was fun to watch. Sure it wasn&#39;t delicious and neither was it marvelous, but definitely something you can watch on a Saturday night with nothing else to do. Personally, though, I&#39;d choose a nice walk around a gallery given the choice.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe music was also pretty darn good, sucks you right in and makes your mind dance to their flute. Damn bastards have the algorithm fully figured out &#8211; just like all those serially produced pop princesses.\n</p>\n<p>\nAll in all, it was fun, but I wouldn&#39;t go see it again, not for that kind of price.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fff0a707-5456-5f9f-832f-ec3ed7606ae6"}}
