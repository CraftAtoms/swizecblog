Spurred on by the success of <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js\">React+d3js</a>, it was time to get serious.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/i6gmKrF.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>Every week, I would write down some numbers, take stock of how I pushed my side-hustle forward, and brainstorm some ideas on what to do next. Here&#8217;s what that first page said:</p>\n<p><strong>Sales this week</strong> &#8211; <em>Aug 9th, 2015 &#8211; Aug 15th, 2015</em>: </p>\n<p>10 Student packages -&gt; $87</p>\n<p>1 Engineer package -&gt; $59</p>\n<p><strong>Audience</strong>:</p>\n<p>Udemy course -&gt; 112 students<sup><a href=\"#fn1-1729\" id=\"fnr1-1729\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>Reactd3 email subscribers -&gt; 160</p>\n<p>Blog subscribers -&gt; 78</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>React page views: 380</p>\n<p>Adwords: $70, 11k views, 30 clicks</p>\n<p>FB ads: $1, 5 actions, 4 clicks</p>\n<p><strong>Things</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>published promo blogpost, <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/using-react-in-the-real-world/swizec/6710\">this one</a></li>\n<li>adjusted Drip campaign timing</li>\n<li>researched email performance</li>\n<li>started working on React+d3js update</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Result</strong></p>\n<p>$75 profit</p>\n<hr />\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/i6gmKrF.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>This Sunday, I wrote the last page that would fit in this notebook. Most entries were about a week apart, but some had an entire month between them. Life gets busy, and transcribing stats from charts you find online into a notebook is never a priority.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what the last page says:</p>\n<p><strong>Sales this week</strong></p>\n<p>7 student packages -&gt; $117</p>\n<p>4 Why programmers work at night -&gt; $0</p>\n<p>53 ES6 cheatsheet -&gt; $8</p>\n<p><strong>Subscribers</strong></p>\n<p>Reactd3 -&gt; 4,341</p>\n<p>Why programmers work at night -&gt; 736</p>\n<p>Blog -&gt; 944</p>\n<p>Live coding -&gt; 194</p>\n<p>Medium -&gt; 427</p>\n<p><strong>Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>FBads: $46, 29 leads, decent reach</p>\n<p><strong>Result</strong></p>\n<p>$201 loss ?</p>\n<p><strong>Things</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>paid my editor</li>\n<li>I should move this to a spreadsheet</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I probably <em>should</em> move my diary into a spreadsheet, but I&#8217;m on the fence about this. A spreadsheet makes it easier to look at trends and draw pretty graphs. A notebook makes it easier to appreciate life.</p>\n<p>And yes, the last week in this diary is a $201 loss while the first week was a $75 profit. What a colossal failure! But not really. It fluctuates. Unlike a year ago, I have an editor now. I pay somebody to look at every single thing I publish.</p>\n<p>I started looking for one right after that first week in the diary. A few weeks later, I had an editor. My side-hustle usually has a loss on the weeks that his monthly invoice comes through.</p>\n<p>Such is life.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here&#8217;s what happened in this year of side-hustling:</p>\n<p><strong>React Indie Bundle</strong> &#8211; 6 authors, 1 sale, $30k in a week</p>\n<p><strong>React+d3js ES6</strong> &#8211; book rewrite, relaunch, $9k in first month</p>\n<p><strong>Weekly livecoding</strong> &#8211; pure fun, excuse to do cool shit</p>\n<p><strong>React+D3 workshops</strong> &#8211; 3 iterations, about $9k</p>\n<p><strong>ES6 cheatsheet</strong> &#8211; 1,184 emails, $314</p>\n<p><strong>Daily blogging experiment</strong> &#8211; ongoing, stay tuned</p>\n<p>$27k in my share of sales<sup><a href=\"#fn2-1729\" id=\"fnr2-1729\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>; 4 products launched; 2 things started to encourage doing cool shit; $4k spent on advertising; $2k on consultants; and some $2k on education materials. </p>\n<p>Thatâ€™s an overall profit of about $19k.</p>\n<p>Which means I&#8217;m not investing enough in growth.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-1729\">\n<p>This was my Mastering d3.js video course published through Packt.
