{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Oh shit","content":"<p align=\"justify\">\n  Yesterday was an all over bad day it would seem, I was preoccupied with sleeping in front of the telly to write this blog and in hopes of such a coincidentiality being avoided today I&#39;m writing as early as 1700 &#8230; as if that was super early, but hey, all is well if the blog is done right?\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n Sadly, no. Due to some thing or another I haven&#39;t managed to write even a thousand words all since Friday and yeah, you guessed it, that&#39;s really bad, I&#39;m too daunted by the fact to even calculate just how much behind schedule I am, it&#39;s that scary. In all factuality I believe that fussing about wordcount at this moment would cause too much &quot;omg&quot; to provide a good working atmosphere, so I&#39;ll rather focus on writing as much as is possible and hope for the best.\n</p>\n<p align=\"justify\">\n On the other hand &#8230; I did manage to write a whooping 300 words at school today, which acciedentally also happens to be the complete wordcount of today so far.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c1cbcf46-f8b6-5443-ac55-c55e59c4826f"}}
