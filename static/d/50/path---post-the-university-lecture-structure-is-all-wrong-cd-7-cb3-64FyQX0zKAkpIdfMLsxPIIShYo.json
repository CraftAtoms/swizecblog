And yet, I still feel like I&#8217;ve learned a lot and the whole thing was a very worthwhile way of spending time. This is very often the case with outside <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"University\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University\">university</a> lectures, brainfuck to the extreme, yet useful.</p>\n<p>On the other hand we have university lectures. They are only very rarely a complete brainfuck and when they <em>are</em> a brain fucking machine, they&#8217;re so high in the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Stratosphere\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratosphere\">stratosphere</a> you can&#8217;t even begin to hope to start comprehending what the fuck is going on. These are also the kind of lectures you&#8217;d be hard pressed to listen to for more than 45 minutes at a time and are all together almost quite useless.</p>\n<p>So what&#8217;s the difference?</p>\n<p>Well university lectures usually have a lot to say and even more time to say it in. They can go at a painfully slow pace, or the lecturer can decide to cram so much stuff in that it would really take almost a lifetime to understand all of it. But this isn&#8217;t the primary problem.</p>\n<p>What I think really sucks with university lectures is that there is no Q&amp;A time at the end. Sure professors usually encourage us to ask questions, sometimes they even go so far as to finish with &#8220;So are there any questions?&#8221; But they do this all wrong. Most of the time they are verbally asking for questions, but not really behaving like they are prepared to answer questions.</p>\n<p>In a university <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lecture hall\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lecture_hall\">lecture hall</a> the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Professor\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor\">professor</a> might finish by asking for questions. But they do this a minute before the end, often even after the end when everyone&#8217;s in a rush to get to the next thing on their schedule. This isn&#8217;t really a constructive way to conduct a Q&amp;A since people take some time to process what&#8217;s been said and muster a question; there&#8217;s also the small case of anxiety about asking something in front of 200 relative strangers. Asking for questions during the lecture also isn&#8217;t a very good option since people will likely be unwilling to interrupt your reasoning and/or might be afraid you&#8217;ll answer in the rest of the lecture.</p>\n<p>I must admit I don&#8217;t really know the answer to this problem, usually outside university lectures are on a loose schedule and there&#8217;s easily enough time to ask questions. Yesterday I think we spent a good 20 minutes of the two hours just for Q&amp;A. At uni most lectures have to be put within an hour and the perfectly available 15 minutes are spent on what we call academic fifteen &#8230;. perhaps that should be replace by something more useful, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>What do you guys think? Am I completely off my rocker here or could we somehow improve the quality of our classes without delving too much into changing the curriculum?</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/44c0d493-504f-45cf-9559-6f7ce28806a2/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=44c0d493-504f-45cf-9559-6f7ce28806a2\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0f086f15-b7ef-5919-a829-0f4458a39b05"}}
