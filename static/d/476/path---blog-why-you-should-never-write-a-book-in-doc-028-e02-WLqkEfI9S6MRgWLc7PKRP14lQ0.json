In fact you get surprisingly little control and everyone behaves like they know better than you about everything. Which they probably do.</p>\n<p>One thing you get no control over is the format you&#8217;re going to write your book in. But hey, the publisher churns out a new book every week and they&#8217;ve been doing this for years. If somebody knows the best tools to write a book, it&#8217;s going to be them.</p>\n<p>Naturally they ask you to write in <code><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Doc (computing)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_%28computing%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">.doc</a></code>. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Microsoft Word\" href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Word</a> gives you marvelous <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Diff\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">diffing</a> features, there&#8217;s comments, you can do styling and layouting, and it&#8217;s perfect for having multiple people working on the same document simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Wait &#8230; no it isn&#8217;t. In fact Word <em>sucks</em> at all of that!</p>\n<p>My heart sank the moment I opened <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"LibreOffice\" href=\"http://www.libreoffice.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">LibreOffice</a> to start working on <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-with-d3js/book\">Data visualization with d3.js</a> way back in January.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t use Word. Last I checked there still wasn&#8217;t a linux version for my main computer and the pirated copy I have for my Mac crashes as soon as the software runs. Something about fonts.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice isn&#8217;t bad per se, but there are <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/cool-thing-thursday-ia-writer/swizec/5517\">better</a> <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/how-draft-got-me-to-pay-for-a-free-product/swizec/6186\">writing tools</a> out there.</p>\n<p>Especially when it comes to code samples. Why am I dealing with code samples in .doc?</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s what the publisher wants. They even have a fancy base template with all of their custom styles that tell the layouting team what to do. I imagine they export into a better format and work from there.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s difficult to pinpoint why exactly working with this format has been so infuriating, but here are some issues I&#8217;ve run into:</p>\n<p>Because of collaboration you have to turn on <code>record changes</code>. This lets the editors see what you&#8217;ve been up to. But it&#8217;s slow without <code>show changes</code>. Suddenly you&#8217;re working with paragraphs that look like this:</p>\n<div style=\"width: 668px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"A 2nd draft paragraph\" alt=\"A 2nd draft paragraph\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/642?token=Ui_4vIZUy8xFZaqAzJ3gCIX6IyPpqf7pKMZZPos30LSE1XjHHQ_euYZgwllTwfRQKWX6059wGKR8aDbSHHXsipg\" width=\"658\" height=\"175\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A 2nd draft paragraph</p></div>\n<p>This makes it very easy to miss a space here and there or have too many full stops in a row.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a bug in Linux LibreOffice &#8211; not experienced by anyone else online as far as I can tell &#8211; that inserts a blank line after every paragraph with an edited last character. The new line is inserted every time you open the document.</p>\n<p>Which makes editors cross with you and question your sanity.</p>\n<p>And sometimes, randomly, when you change the styling of some text the styling would vanish somewhere between you and the editor.</p>\n<p>Oh and no matter what format you send the document in (I liked <code><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"OpenDocument\" href=\"http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">.odt</a></code> because it causes the least problems for LibreOffice) you will get it back as <code>.docx</code>.</p>\n<p>A format LibreOffice&#8217;s got <em>catastrophic</em> problems with.</p>\n<p>Last week I was happily editing away, acting on the technical feedback I&#8217;d gotten, and after a few days I open the document &#8230; it was 5 pages long. Not the 38 it was supposed to be. Five.</p>\n<p>Everything just up and vanished.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m using <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dropbox\" href=\"http://www.dropbox.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Dropbox</a> so there&#8217;s a backup every time I click Ctrl+S. I&#8217;m safe right?</p>\n<p>The last working version was 37. Out of 131. I was pretty mad.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Version 37 out of 131 is the last that LibreOffice didn‚Äôt corrupt. I am going to strangle <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Packt\" href=\"http://www.packtpub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Packt</a> for making me work in .doc</p>\n<p>‚Äî Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/statuses/375221837510492161\">September 4, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Some 15 pages of editing went <em>poof</em>.</p>\n<p>It happened again a few days ago. But I was more careful and only lost 5 pages. Then I converted all current versions to <code>.odt</code>. That seems to work.</p>\n<p>The collaboration has been wonderful too!</p>\n<p>Because we can&#8217;t all work on the document at the same time, but have to resort to sending it around via email and working in sequence eeeeeverything draaaags oooout foreeever.</p>\n<p>Packt promised I had 3 months to write and then there&#8217;d be a 3 month editing process.</p>\n<p>We blew past that because I&#8217;m a slow writer, but in June I thought the book was done. We&#8217;d spent 3 months writing and 3 months editing.</p>\n<p>Then in the end of August I got technical feedback. Oh yeah.</p>\n<p>Yes editors are people too and they have other shit to do than care about my book and I&#8217;m really happy that one guy in particular (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kmrhb\">@kmrhb</a>) has taken great care to leave a comment next to almost every single paragraph &#8230; but still.</p>\n<p>Apparently a big part of the main editor&#8217;s job is merging all the documents everyone sends her.</p>\n<p>üòê</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how that works, but a lot of the comments I got in late August are dated to early July. Hm.</p>\n<p>If you ever write a book, <em>please</em> use a better tool. Write it in a textual format &#8211; markdown works well &#8211; and use something that shows diffs and helps you merge stuff and lets people comment without having to wait for you to finish.</p>\n<p>Draft looks like it&#8217;s got a lot of those features. I&#8217;ve had great results with Github for my other book. <a href=\"https://github.com/Swizec/nightowls/pulls\"><em>Readers</em> have sent me typo fixes</a> that I can just merge!</p>\n<p>Whatever you do, don&#8217;t write a book in .doc.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=f350f8fa-a9bf-4564-8a6f-07ec355d2aaa\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c50a7f23-7de5-55fa-aac6-400e4ab89acf"}}
