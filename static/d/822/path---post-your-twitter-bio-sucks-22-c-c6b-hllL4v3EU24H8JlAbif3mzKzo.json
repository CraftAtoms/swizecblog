{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Your Twitter bio sucks &#8211; I think I can fix it","content":"<p>Two weeks ago I moved to a different continent and I have to say, the biggest culture shock was my very own twitter stream. It&#8217;s still the same stream, but with a 9 hours different timezone everything is so new and shiny and weird and strange and it feels like I don&#8217;t know anybody!</p>\n<p>And I have to <em>follow people</em>.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twitter_Inc_HQ.jpg\"><img title=\"Twitter Inc HQ\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/300px-Twitter_Inc_HQ.jpg\" alt=\"Twitter Inc HQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n</div>\n<p><em>New people.</em></p>\n<p>Back home I already have a pretty busy stream and I don&#8217;t really feel the need to follow people unless they&#8217;re really anyone interesting. I also don&#8217;t actually get to accidentally meet new people because I apparently already follow the majority of those who are active.</p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\">tl;dr &#8211;&gt; if you hate buzzy lame twitter bios, <a href=\"mailto:swizec@swizec.com?subject=long bios suck!\">send me an email</a></em></p>\n<p>But here in the US the situation is different. I feel like a newbie user. Stumbling upon cool people. Stumbling upon obnoxious marketers I haven&#8217;t learned to ignore yet. Stumbling upon &#8230; stuff.</p>\n<p><!--more-->It&#8217;s almost like discovering the service anew.</p>\n<p>Except it&#8217;s different.</p>\n<p>Very different.</p>\n<p>Now that I could claim that I&#8217;m not a newbie anymore (because I&#8217;ve been here all summer, for those who get the joke :P) &#8230; I can actually see how horrible twitter is for discovering <em>cool </em>andÂ <em>interesting </em>people.</p>\n<h2>Your bio sucks</h2>\n<p>The problem is that everyone&#8217;s bio looks something like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8216;The king of cabaret noir&#8217; &#8211; The Metro. Gin addled vaudevillian musical reprobate. Smut peddler. Full time audience antagonist. Tweets about stuff.</p>\n<p>Social Business/Creative Technologist, Open &amp; Social, Ex-MySpace (07-09), Dropping pooh sticks in the stream of consciousness. All opinions my own</p>\n<p>SQL Server MVP and C# developer. Creator of SSMS Tools Pack add-in for SSMS.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>It sucks. It suck donkey balls! These things don&#8217;t tell me anything. Usually they&#8217;re just a bunch of buzzwords that sound impressive to a drunk monkey on a Monday night. What I want on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://twitter.com\">Twitter</a> are <em>people</em>. Actual, down to earth, people.</p>\n<p>People I can talk to, people I can make a real connection with.</p>\n<p>The bios aren&#8217;t helping.</p>\n<p>To borrow the bio of @vanfranco -&gt; &#8220;Writing a bio is like giving someone the best highlights of your career packed into a tiny space.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not &#8230; at least it shouldn&#8217;t be!</p>\n<p>Why do you want to do that?</p>\n<p>The only reason you could possibly want to do that is because you don&#8217;t know who you are. Don&#8217;t have a good identity. And are probably boring to boot.</p>\n<h2>The true gems of bios</h2>\n<p>Let me share some of the best bios I&#8217;ve seen:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I am a VC</p>\n<p>Superhero. World explorer.</p>\n<p>grinds Toni Braxton in Vegas</p>\n<p>a chihuahua with a split personality. bid on ebay.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Short. To the point. Makes me want to follow these people immediately. They look like they know where they&#8217;re going, the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Somebody Else's Problem\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_Else%27s_Problem\">SEP field</a> doesn&#8217;t work on them &#8230; these are the people I want to talk to. The kind of people I want to hang out with!</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m sure many of you are the same. We like people who aren&#8217;t afraid of who they really are.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Twttr_sketch-Dorsey-2006.jpg\"><img title=\"Sketch for Twitter.

Something that tells exactly one thing about you.</p>\n<p>On the other, there&#8217;s more to yourself than a single identifying thing. And you want to list all of them.</p>\n<p>What if there was a service that let you enter several short facts about yourself. It would then pick a random short fact every couple of days and change your bio. This way every time some new person looks at your profile, you look like you know what you&#8217;re doing, but at the same time you get to keep all the variety and information.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m proposing to build this service. All I need to know now is if anyone else besides me would want to use it ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Send me an email to <a href=\"mailto:swizec@swizec.com?subject=long bios suck!\">swizec@swizec.com</a> if you think this is a good idea.
