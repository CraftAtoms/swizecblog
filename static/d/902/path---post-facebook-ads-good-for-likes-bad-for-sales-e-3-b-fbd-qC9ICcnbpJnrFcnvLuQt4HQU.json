Promoting <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/nightowls\">my ebook</a> just a little bit so I know what to expect.</p>\n<p>I decided to go for two ad types &#8211; the news feed and the sidebar on the right. My campaign ran for 12 days, May 27th to June 8th and had a potential reach of 32,000,000 people. All interested in technology, launching tech businesses and being early adopters.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t target for <em>&#8220;In a relationship with somebody like the above.&#8221;</em>. Bummer, but this demographic will do.</p>\n<h2>The effect</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 633px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Effect on traffic\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/5QEjVcxuRLezUjQGb11Q\" alt=\"Effect on traffic\" width=\"623\" height=\"194\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Effect on traffic</p></div>\n<p>In those 12 days I spent $158.91 and made 15 sales &#8211; $65.85 in royalties. A loss of almost 60%, made worse by the fact many of the sales didn&#8217;t come through facebook. But the news feed post did get 45 likes and the facebook page I haven&#8217;t made yet got 61 likes.</p>\n<p>How does a page that doesn&#8217;t exist get 61 likes anyway? Guess I have to make it now.</p>\n<p>All in all, my ads had a reach of 88,738 people. About 55k for the news feed ad and about 33k for the right side ad. A far cry from the 32 million potential I was offered, but hey, that $15/day budget didn&#8217;t last very long.</p>\n<p>Comparing conversions for the two ads is pretty interesting as well.</p>\n<p>The news feed ad got 1,418 clicks (like or link) with a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Click-through rate\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">click-through rate</a> of 2.44%, while the sidebar ad stacked up a measly 11 clicks for a click-through rate of just 0.012%.</p>\n<p>Sidebar clicks cost more too &#8211; $0.58 vs. $0.11 for the news feed.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 791px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Conversions\" src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/EfMY6HFATWCyck4BcKKf\" alt=\"Conversions\" width=\"781\" height=\"456\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Conversions</p></div>\n<p>Despite the significant increase in traffic for the 12 days, it seems that either Facebook users aren&#8217;t very interested in buying, or my landing page is terrible at converting traffic into sales.</p>\n<p>For my next experiment I&#8217;ll use <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"AdSense\" href=\"http://www.google.com/adsense\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Google Ads</a> and see what happens there.
