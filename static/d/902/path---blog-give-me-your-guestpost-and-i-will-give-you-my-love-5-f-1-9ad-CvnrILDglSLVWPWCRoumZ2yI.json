Three (possibly four) exams and giving a short talk &#8230; that needs to be prepared, delivered and the resulting lady fans wooed.</p>\n<p>You know how it goes.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to go into radio silence for a whole week. Writing crappy quickies all week is severely undesirable as well.</p>\n<p>SO,</p>\n<p>if you&#8217;ve got <em>anything</em> to say, anything at all, say it here.</p>\n<p>Write a guest post for this site on anything ranging from science, to tea and the startup world. I&#8217;m not particularly picky, but I want to feel a human voice (as opposed to a generic marketing post spam)</p>\n<p>Why would you do that? Because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You shall win my eternal gratitude. I will owe you <strong>two</strong> not one (favour, blogpost, whatever)</li>\n<li>Your post will land in ~800 adoring RSS readers</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m going to tweet your post exactly three times. That gets a reader or two</li>\n<li>I will lovingly spoon feed your post to all 1700 of my G+ humans</li>\n<li>Did I mention I&#8217;m going to love you forever?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If that isn&#8217;t enough to convince you, I have attached a cute hedgehog. You can&#8217;t say no to something <em>that</em> cute. Fact.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=52e52a66-a751-4359-8e0c-782dedbbe282\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3fbee67e-e956-5767-93ba-f14e4f9423b0"}}
