It sounds terrible, but it‚Äôs similar to numbers I&#8217;ve seen elsewhere. Honestly, I thought it was worse.</p>\n<p>Convincing people to swipe their card is hard. Especially if it&#8217;s for a monthly subscription.</p>\n<p>Of those 7,517 people, only 51 clicked <code>No</code>. They were taken to a Google Form with a single input box. <em>Why not?</em></p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7663\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-form-screenshot.jpg\" width=\"1248\" height=\"1584\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-form-screenshot.jpg 1248w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-form-screenshot-236x300.jpg 236w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-form-screenshot-768x975.jpg 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/google-form-screenshot-807x1024.jpg 807w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1248px) 100vw, 1248px\" />\n<p>Of those 51, 10 people wrote great feedback (for the most part).</p>\n<p>One meanie said <em>&#8220;No‚Äù</em>, and another meanie said <em>&#8220;stop writing&#8221;</em>. Those were‚Ä¶ uncalled for.</p>\n<p>But I also got great feedback like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI like your business insights and your honesty, but I&#8217;m not a React guy (which you talk about) (I&#8217;m the bright side &#8211; called VueJS :). Also, I wish you would cover more ground in your emails, more links thoughts and resources. Keep up your good work though &#8211; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find the perfect product-market-fit!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>And stuff like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nSometimes entertaining/informative, way too random and inconsistent to pay for.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Or this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nI like the tone of your emails, they are always fun to read, and I almost always will open them. But a lot of the content I cannot use in my daily work. I guess I feel like the scope is very large. I tend to like content that helps me solve an isolated and specific problem.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Overall, people seem to enjoy my emails, but not enough to pay for. Which makes sense. Why would you pay for something that doesn&#8217;t feel like a coherent product?</p>\n<p>My weekly emails just aren&#8217;t a coherent product (yet?). Maybe one day they will be, maybe they won&#8217;t. It&#8217;s hard to decide which direction to take it all because I think a large part of what makes a great engineer is his or her breadth of knowledge. And it&#8217;s that breadth that I want to offer.</p>\n<p>But breadth is difficult to productize. That&#8217;s why my flagship product is a book that talks about putting just two libraries together üòÄ</p>\n<p>Overall, I can&#8217;t decide if the Patreon experiment is a great success or a total bust.</p>\n<p>$37 monthly recurring revenue is pretty cool, but it‚Äôs nothing to write home about. Can it grow from here? Could I get to a point where I don&#8217;t have to sell products anymore and could rely just on monthly subscriptions in a few months to a year?</p>\n<p>¬Ø&#92;_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>\n<p>Would be nice, tho. Launches are stressful and putting books and courses together is always harder than it looks.</p>\n<p>Most of all, 226 people who said <em>&#8220;Yes, I enjoy this as much as caffeine&#8221;</em> versus 51 who said <em>&#8220;Nah&#8221;</em>, <strong>that&#8217;s</strong> a win. I&#8217;m doing something right; now I just have to figure out what it is. üòÖ</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f901411e-6c71-53f9-9751-4e7cacb18402"}}
