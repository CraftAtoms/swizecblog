But not just sitting around and waiting to die kind of 100+, the kind where at 100 you&#8217;re still happily running around, building fences and doing stupid crap most westerners really wouldn&#8217;t expect you to do anymore.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"446\" height=\"326\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\" /><param name=\"bgColor\" value=\"#ffffff\" /><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/DanBuettner_2009X-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanBuettner-2009X.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=727&amp;introDuration=16500&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=2000&amp;adKeys=talk=dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100;year=2009;theme=might_you_live_a_great_deal_longer;theme=unconventional_explanations;theme=what_makes_us_happy;theme=new_on_ted_com;event=TEDxTC;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" /><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#ffffff\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"446\" height=\"326\" src=\"http://video.ted.com/assets/player/swf/EmbedPlayer.swf\" flashvars=\"vu=http://video.ted.com/talks/dynamic/DanBuettner_2009X-medium.flv&amp;su=http://images.ted.com/images/ted/tedindex/embed-posters/DanBuettner-2009X.embed_thumbnail.jpg&amp;vw=432&amp;vh=240&amp;ap=0&amp;ti=727&amp;introDuration=16500&amp;adDuration=4000&amp;postAdDuration=2000&amp;adKeys=talk=dan_buettner_how_to_live_to_be_100;year=2009;theme=might_you_live_a_great_deal_longer;theme=unconventional_explanations;theme=what_makes_us_happy;theme=new_on_ted_com;event=TEDxTC;&amp;preAdTag=tconf.ted/embed;tile=1;sz=512x288;\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>Everything in there is fine and good, but the most important bottom line I picked up on was the importance of having an <em>ikigai</em>. It&#8217;s all wonderfully explained in the video so I won&#8217;t go into what ikigai is, I&#8217;d rather say a little bit about what it feels like to discover one&#8217;s ikigai. (it doesn&#8217;t matter whether you know what it&#8217;s called or not, I didn&#8217;t for months)</p>\n<p>As late as just last Spring my life revolved around going to a school I hated, having a job that was alright but not quite <em>that</em> and occasionally getting together with my girlfriend. I was doing some nifty stuff in the evenings and late at night, but mostly it was just another burden no matter how much I loved it and felt like I believed in it.</p>\n<p>Then something changed, I can&#8217;t exactly put my finger on it, but it changed. The symptom of this change was that I quit my job and devoted most of my attention to the side-project, which evolved far far far away from what it was back then.</p>\n<p>And suddenly much was different. School suddenly seemed interesting and awesome, I started learning exciting new things every day for the first time since being a kid. Getting up in the morning was &#8230; well it&#8217;s still fucking hard, I&#8217;m just not a morning person ðŸ˜› &#8230; but staying up at night was painless as hell. Meh, I won&#8217;t pretend like I can describe this, just try it.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/41e4a41d-a6dd-400e-aecf-26c5f4ec51c7/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=41e4a41d-a6dd-400e-aecf-26c5f4ec51c7\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9ab8824c-8a04-5ab8-b8e9-fc1c6fa51fbb"}}
