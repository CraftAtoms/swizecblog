It was a fun and interesting trip, don&#8217;t get me wrong, and I still love London almost as much as I did after my last trip there two years ago. It&#8217;s just that pretty much everything imaginable that could go wrong actually done gone wrong and the culmination of this was that we didn&#8217;t advance to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Seedcamp\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.seedcamp.com\">Seedcamp</a> week.</p>\n<p>But let me start from the beginning. Day one went great, we finished the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Linear algebra\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra\">linear algebra</a> exam (flunked it yet again btw) and set of to Munich for the flight. The ride went spectacularly smooth and we got to our flight on time. And that&#8217;s when the trouble started.</p>\n<p>During the day I got some more ideas on how to polish our presentation and decided to do them at the airport. There wasn&#8217;t enough time. Alright, I&#8217;ll do them on the aeorplane. Oh crap, aeroplanes don&#8217;t have internets, no go. Very well, can&#8217;t do the presentation, can&#8217;t do the polishing on the demo. Fine.</p>\n<p>So then we got to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"London Gatwick Airport\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Gatwick_Airport\">Gatwick</a> and paid through the nose to get to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"London Victoria station\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Victoria_station\">Victoria station</a>. Now what? Well after a brief search for somewhere to stay, we took a ride off to Pimlico where the fucking shoebox was ready to take us in. It was a twin bed </p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ab66a81-7e10-50eb-84a4-142c1ba0a6d4"}}
