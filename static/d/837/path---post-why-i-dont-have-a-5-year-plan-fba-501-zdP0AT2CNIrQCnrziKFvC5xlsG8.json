Five year plans are a bit like towels, always having one isn&#8217;t so much useful as it is a signal of responsibility and being a stand up guy. You&#8217;re always supposed to have a 5-year plan!</p>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t. Never have. Never will.</p>\n<p>This surprises people. It&#8217;s not the answer they expect from an obviously career-driven 26 year old megalomaniac who wears button up shirts and shoes that go klak when you walk. Almost as surprising as never having voted in my life.</p>\n<p>You see, people ask about your 5-year plan out of two reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>assessing what you want from life when considering long-term business deals</li>\n<li>building familiarity by asking about what you want from life</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you say <em>&#8220;Yeah I don&#8217;t really have a plan. They&#8217;re either too realistic and undershoot what actually happens, or they are dreams and you&#8217;re left disappointed by reality.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s the gist of the problem. Plans are either dreams &#8211; <em>&#8220;I am most def selling 10,000 copies of my book this year! I can just see the troves of adoring fans!&#8221;</em>, or it&#8217;s too restrictive and limits you to a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Local optimum\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_optimum\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">local optimum</a> &#8211; <em>&#8220;I have to focus now, no time for that party where all the biggest tech people in my city are going to be that I&#8217;ve been invited to.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done both. It&#8217;s stupid.</p>\n<p>Life is actually just a multivariate <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Search problem\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_problem\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">search problem</a>. Except you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>\n<p>Rather than a plan, I have a search function. My life is a space of possibilities and at key moments, the search function decides where I&#8217;m going.</p>\n<p>All I have to do is decide the optimisation parameters. Do I want more money, more reach, more fame and recognition, punch out cool code, or write a book? Maybe just meet more people and make friends?</p>\n<p>Whatever it is, I plug it into the function and voila. Life starts turning in that direction. I get more business deals, or I write more blogpost, or just make a bunch of new friends and expand my social circle.</p>\n<p>The important part is, I don&#8217;t have to know where I am going. Life makes sure I eventually get exactly what I want. It&#8217;s really neat.</p>\n<p>For a simple example, you can think of it as finding the tallest peak in a mountain range. Your optimisation parameter is having the highest possible Z. So generally speaking you should be walking uphill.</p>\n<p>Eventually you reach a peak and every next step you make is going to be downhill. So you look around, you reassess, and out there in the distance, you see a taller hill.</p>\n<p>Now your optimisation parameters are reducing Z, and aiming X and Y generally in the direction of that hill.</p>\n<p>Every step you make, you look at your function and take the best possible step. Day to day, you never have to know where you&#8217;re going. But eventually you will come up to that peak and it&#8217;s going to be awesome and you will be really happy.</p>\n<p>Then you reassess. And what&#8217;s that if not another even taller hill?</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=6e372d7f-5b24-4e1a-a5de-28df068663ba\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"db8fa4ff-b4fb-5843-8bed-7427fc29a1f7"}}
