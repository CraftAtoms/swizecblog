But over time it became simply annoying. Only on one computer, always pestering me about &#8220;OMG you forgot to do this! OMG it&#8217;s already 100 days overdue! OHMYFUCKINGGODMAN!!!&#8221;</p>\n<p>Yeah, fuck that shit.</p>\n<p>Out of all the things the whiteboard seemed the most efficient way of doing things. There it is, always on the wall, every task I haven&#8217;t completed staring me in the face every time I turn around. Not judging, just gently reminding me that hey, I might as well do it if I ever want to see a clean whiteboard again.</p>\n<p>But hey, that&#8217;s not very portable either. There&#8217;s one at the office and another one in my bedroom. Any task that isn&#8217;t strictly tied to a one room radius of the whiteboard will never get executed because I&#8217;ll forget about it on my way out the door &#8230;</p>\n<p>And then along comes <a href=\"http://workflowy.com\" target=\"_blank\">Workflowy</a> with a small post on HackerNews saying &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re from YC2k9 and we&#8217;ve launched. We help you organize your brain&#8221; (this was a week or two ago)</p>\n<p>Then I watched their video. And I drooled!</p>\n<p>Workflowy was exactly the app I&#8217;ve been looking for. It was love at first sight.</p>\n<p>Basically what they give you is an infinite online whiteboard that you can take anywhere.</p>\n<p>Awesome! Brilliant! Doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe it.</p>\n<p>Everything you write on Workflowy is a nested bulletpoint list. This is where it gets mindblowingly awesomer than an old fashioned <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/time_management\" title=\"Time management\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management\">TODO list</a>.</p>\n<p>The old way was writing a list of items you have to do in a somewhat hierarchical order. God forbid you have to switch contexts ten times a day and end up with a big mess.</p>\n<p>Workflowy is a bit more like git. You have branches running in parallel. The way I use it is to have the top level represent a list of contexts I work on and then on the second level I just jot down the workflow. It&#8217;s not exactly a TODO list, it&#8217;s more of a &#8220;OK here&#8217;s how I&#8217;m gonna tackle this problem&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Because of how my brain works it&#8217;s really quite a bit less organized than a TODO list. But it still helps me not fuck things up by forgetting them.</p>\n<p>Like, you could do something like this:</p>\n<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-24-at-12.33.17-AM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1496\" title=\"Workflowy example\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-24-at-12.33.17-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"903\" height=\"570\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-24-at-12.33.17-AM.png 903w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-24-at-12.33.17-AM-300x189.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" /></a>\n<p>And you&#8217;re set!</p>\n<p>Really, I urge everyone who doesn&#8217;t like their organisation tool to force them into boxes and limit the way they work to try out Workflowy.</p>\n<p>Actually the only thing I dislike right now is that it doesn&#8217;t work on <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/handheld_device\" title=\"Mobile device\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device\">mobile devices</a>, not even tablets. Just gives you a warning that hey, you&#8217;re a smartphone, fuck you and come back later when we do support you.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a bit lame especially considering Mobile Safari is plenty strong enough to support everything you need. Maybe it&#8217;s got something to do with their monetization strategy; get us hooked on the web version then sell the <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/iphone_os\" title=\"IOS (Apple)\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://developer.apple.com/iphone\">iOS</a> app for shitloads of money &#8230; (hopefully this loving post is enough to get them to give me free stuff :P)</p>\n<p><em>Update: apparently a MVP of mobile support is due to come out in a few days.</em></p>\n<p>Anyway, yeah, try them out. They&#8217;re cool.</p>\n<p>Oh and as far as the UI goes. I love it because it&#8217;s Spartan and no-nonsense and lets me do everything via simple to remember keyboard shortcuts. Please don&#8217;t add any more features. kthxbai</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/11/04/workflow/\">Turn Your Entire Life Into A List With Workflowy</a> (techcrunch.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.workflowy.com/\">WorkFlowy &#8211; Make Lists.
