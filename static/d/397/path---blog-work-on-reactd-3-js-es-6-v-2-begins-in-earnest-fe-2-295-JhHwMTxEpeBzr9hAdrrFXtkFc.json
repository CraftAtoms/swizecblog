This time as a free upgrade for current users.</p>\n<p>It’s a free upgrade because there was too much messiness when I launched the rewrite of my 2015 book of almost the same title. It wasn’t worth the effort and unhappiness that it causes.</p>\n<p>When my editor edits this post, he will shit his pants because I haven’t told him yet. But I hope it works out. ?  <em>[EDITOR’S NOTE: I was a bit surprised.]</em></p>\n<p>The plan so far looks like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>man up and fix all <a href=\"https://github.com/Swizec/react-d3js-es6-ebook/issues\">these bugs</a> that @micahstubs reported</li>\n<li>remove all the environment setup stuff and replace it with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html\">create-react-app</a></li>\n<li>improve the animations chapter\n<ul>\n<li>add more theoretical explanation</li>\n<li>break down concepts better</li>\n<li>add transitions approach</li>\n<li>discuss pre-made libraries and when to use them</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>add a chapter on using canvas for rendering</li>\n<li>talk about achieving high performance</li>\n<li>add a chapter on visualizations in react-native</li>\n<li>build a server-side visualization rendering example</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And biggest of all → wrestle <a href=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/swizec/\">36 hours of live coding video</a> into a coherent video course that’s worth proper money. Something on the level of those epic React+D3 workshops we did with Freddy<sup><a id=\"fnr1-20846\" class=\"footnote\" title=\"see footnote\" href=\"#fn1-20846\">1</a></sup>, but online and scalable and actually longer.</p>\n<p>I’m sure 36 hours of video is enough to build a killer course. All I need is some help with editing.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What did I miss? What did I not put in the content plan, but should?</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-20846\">3 workshops happened.
