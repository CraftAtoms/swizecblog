{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"The Dresden Dolls Insanity","content":"<p>\nThe Dresden Dolls are releasing a new album called No, Virginia. So far I&#39;ve only heard one song from it, simply because youtube shoved it in my face, and it&#39;s looking awesome. Classic Dolls, all the weirdness I&#39;ve come to expect and yet all the  melody I enjoy.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn order to help their release along they&#39;ve decided to hold a special little contest for everyone who pre-orders. The winner, supposedly randomly selected, gets a toy piano and the stool to go with it. The piano was featured in a, sadly cut, scene of the Coin-Operated Boy video. Plus some other far less important stuff.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow I know there&#39;s next to no chance of me getting that piano, but I damned well wanted the CD. My first purchased CD since &#8230; err &#8230; 2000? Wow. Anyhow, there was a choice of three e-stores to order from. One offers just the CD, another a CD and a discount t-shirt and the last an <em>autographed</em> CD.\n</p>\n<p>\nNaturally I wanted the autographed one. But what&#39;s this? They don&#39;t ship to Slovenia even though they ship to other parts of the EU? Bloody bastards!\n</p>\n<p>\nEventually I managed to order to a proxy in the UK who&#39;s then going to send it to me. Terribly complex and uselessly convoluted and for what, because an e-store is stupid.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2727b797-0104-54e9-90dd-89c9f9b84d33"}}
