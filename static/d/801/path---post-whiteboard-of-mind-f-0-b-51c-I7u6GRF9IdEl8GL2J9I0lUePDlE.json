Often been needing one, but since I didn&#39;t have one of my own I was left hanging and had to rely on mental imagery, which tends to take a little longer because the mind often drifts, loses focus, and it&#39;s a general pain in the arse having to think so hard as to see a large algorithm in your head.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe board came in a large package and it was like christmas all over, but somehow I managed to restrain myself to opening it only after I&#39;d finished most of my work. The huge huge bubblewrap &#8230; thing &#8230; I took home and had my way with it. Those things are awesome!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"84042304-c9fc-575a-b57e-96be2eb2edae"}}
