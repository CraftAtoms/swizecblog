Let&#8217;s try to fatten up a bit. How hard could it be to gain 4kg in two months?</p>\n<p>Extremely hard!</p>\n<p>Since I was already tracking calories I only set myfitnesspal to <em>&#8220;<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Weight gain\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_gain\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">gain weight</a>&#8220;</em>Â and tried to stuff my face full of food every day. The first week I went down a whole kilogram. The next week I was almost back to before I started. Now I&#8217;m just under two kilograms heavier than I was two months ago.</p>\n<p>What?</p>\n<p>Whenever I get excited on twitter about gaining half a kilogram or so, a bunch of tweets fly in from people saying something to the effect of <em>&#8220;Oh how I wish I had your problem! How dare you make it sound so difficult to be fat?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Well, to those people I would say they can&#8217;t really complain until they give my exercise regimen a try &#8211; 40 minutes of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Body weight\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">body-weight</a> and cardio every morning before breakfast, boxing practice two or three times a week, longboarding session as often as possible and using walking/longboarding as the main mode of transport.</p>\n<p>If you can do all that and be fat, tell me your secret! I&#8217;m trying to gain some weight here!</p>\n<p>The experiment wasn&#8217;t a complete wash though. Some benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>infinite energy</strong>Â &#8211; because I&#8217;m constantly stuffing my face, it seems I get tired later in the day and mornings are easier. Better yet, my morning boot up time shortened to almost instant. I&#8217;m dezombified almost immediately after waking up!</li>\n<li><strong>less sleep</strong>Â &#8211; somewhat related is the fact I seem to need less sleep. 6 hours a day has always been plenty, but I needed to recharge a bit on weekends (8 hours). Nowadays the 8 hour sleep only happens twice or thrice a month. Awesome.</li>\n<li><strong>stable energy</strong><em>Â &#8211; </em>getting obvious here with the energy pattern &#8211; but I simply can&#8217;t scoff down enough food in three sittings. This means I have to eat food, real food, none of that snacks crap, every two to three hours. This makes me constantly energized, without any of those afternoon lulls in energy levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While all of that is super awesome &#8211; and should have been completely obvious &#8211; there is one giant drawback to all of this. It seems I need to eat <em>constantly</em>. Every. Two. Freaking. Hours. Or three.</p>\n<p>This is a huge pain in the arse. Not only do I have to find a way to eat real food when I&#8217;m at class for six hours straight, it&#8217;s also very distracting when I&#8217;m working.Â Imagine being fully immersed in the flow, working on an interesting problem and then juuuuust as you&#8217;re about to crack the problem &#8230; oh right, I have to eat again.</p>\n<p>And then you waste at least half an hour preparing and eating food. By the time you&#8217;re done, the proverbial glass palace in your head has already shattered and it takes forever to get back to work.</p>\n<p>But hey, I can exercise much harder while getting less tired. That&#8217;s good too ðŸ™‚</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"This is not me longboarding\" src=\"http://images.usatoday.com/sports/_photos/2006-06-20-longboard1.jpg\" alt=\"This is not me longboarding\" width=\"472\" height=\"270\" />\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.drsharma.ca/obesity-close-concerns-stopping-the-gain.html\" target=\"_blank\">Close Concerns: Stopping The Gain</a> (drsharma.ca)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.everydayhealth.com/weight/simple-ways-to-gain-weight.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Ways to Gain Weight</a> (everydayhealth.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jasonmachowsky.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/one-for-the-weight-gainers/\" target=\"_blank\">One for the Weight Gainers&#8230;</a> (jasonmachowsky.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://sonjaolafs.wordpress.com/2012/04/30/myth-of-the-week/\" target=\"_blank\">Myth of the Week</a> (sonjaolafs.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2012-05/aaos-lst042612.php\" target=\"_blank\">Longer sleep times may counteract genetic factors related to weight gain</a> (eurekalert.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.pbpulse.com/dining/brunch/2012/03/30/that-girl-longboards-makes-brunch-a-laid-back-affair/\" target=\"_blank\">That Girl: Longboards makes brunch a laid-back affair</a> (pbpulse.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://hackaday.com/2012/04/17/all-aluminum-longboard-shows-its-mettle/\" target=\"_blank\">All Aluminum Longboard Shows Its Mettle</a> (hackaday.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=9a2bde12-8a81-4686-96ee-0fa3f80c7b35\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c8002181-e398-56af-91de-073665e076f8"}}
