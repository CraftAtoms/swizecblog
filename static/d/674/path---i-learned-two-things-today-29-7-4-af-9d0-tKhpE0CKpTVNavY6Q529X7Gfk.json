Decided to go on a caffeine diet for a couple of days and today was possibly the most miserable I have been in quite a while. Zombied through the day.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I learned is that taking two hours off in the middle of the afternoon to watch some shows when you&#8217;re feeling like your head is about to roll off your shoulders and into a gutter full of poo &#8230; the world doesn&#8217;t come crawling to a halt. The work waits for you. And nobody but yourself thinks any worse of you. Taking a break <em>works</em>Â bitchz.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_caffeine_against_the_word_of_wisdom\">Is caffeine against the word of wisdom</a> (wiki.answers.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.losethattyre.co.uk/five-benefits-of-giving-up-caffeine/\">Five Benefits of Giving up Caffeine</a> (losethattyre.co.uk)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=405429b1-af19-4f52-80a1-1e0caa8e1a4d\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"debe59be-6cfa-55fc-84be-2a8021cb285d"}}
