It was the lowest earning month of the year so far, but it wasnâ€™t quite as bad as I expected.</p>\n<p>I took 2 weeks off the sidehustle. I did nothing but enjoy Europe and make <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hL3pGjTlvio&#038;list=PLF8WgaD4xmjUn5WldUkcy6YH1vLt7zbAx\">a daily vlog</a>. There was next-to-no activity on social media, I ignored my email inbox, I ignored Twitter, and I mostly ignored Facebook.</p>\n<p>No new technical content, nothing really.</p>\n<p>And yet, $2529 of revenue. Either the daily vlog drove sales, thus proving my hypothesis that <em>&#8220;Publishing anything at all, no matter what, drives sales&#8221;</em>, or I have a solid baseline and my time spent writing articles, livecoding, and making videos is mostly wasted effort.</p>\n<p>Then again, I enjoy doing it. It&#8217;s my idea incubator, and it does improve sales by a few thousand dollars. <em>shrug</em></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how it breaks down.</p>\n<p><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $2529</p>\n<p><strong>Gumroad sales:</strong> $857</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React D3v4 preorders: $98 &#8211; fees</li>\n<li>ES6 Cheatsheet: $7 &#8211; fees</li>\n<li>React D3 ES6: $955 &#8211; fees</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**Leanpub sales: ** $309</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React D3: $22</li>\n<li>React D3 ES6: $287</li>\n</ul>\n<p>**React Native School: ** $1361</p>\n<p>**Time investment: ** 68 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Costs:</strong> $1837</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Editor: $500</li>\n<li>VA: $368</li>\n<li>Ads: $422</li>\n<li>Drip: $184</li>\n<li>Hosting: $10</li>\n<li>LiveEdu account: $10</li>\n<li>SumoMe: $99</li>\n<li>Mailchimp: $20</li>\n<li>Stock music: $99</li>\n<li>CreativeCommons music: $12</li>\n<li>Tech: $113</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the life of me, I can&#8217;t remember what tech purchase I made for $113. I&#8217;m sure it was necessary ðŸ¤”</p>\n<p>The biggest waste of money was the stock music purchase. It seemed like a great idea for the vlogs, but all their stuff had that awful &#8220;this is stock audio&#8221; feel to it. The <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/creativecommonsmusicfree\">Creative Commons music on Soundcloud</a> sounds a lot better.</p>\n<p>**Net hourly rate: ** $10</p>\n<p>Based on hourly rate economics, daily vlogging looks like a waste of time after all. â€™Twas a fun experiment, tho.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"bc0bcd7a-fc4a-540b-9b1a-f72607a265f0"}}
