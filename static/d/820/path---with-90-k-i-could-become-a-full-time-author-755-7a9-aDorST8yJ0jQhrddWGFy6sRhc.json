Three months post facto. Of course.</p>\n<p>676 euro.</p>\n<p>About a month&#8217;s worth of post-tax <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Minimum wage\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_wage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">minimum pay</a> in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Slovenia\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.05,14.5&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=46.05,14.5 (Slovenia)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Slovenia</a> for nothing but sitting on my arse doing other things. Except it&#8217;s pre-tax. Still, could be worse.</p>\n<p>My effective hourly rate for <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-with-d3js/book\">Data Visualization with d3.js </a> is now €5.1/hour. Up from the €3 it was last time.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s the beauty of writing books.</p>\n<p>After the initial blood and sweat and tears, I don&#8217;t have to do anything. As long as it keeps selling, money keeps hitting my bank account. Were I to do some active promotion and build a newsletter or some manner of business around the books, sales would be even better.</p>\n<p>Similar to what&#8217;s happening with my other book &#8211; <a href=\"http://nightowlsbook.com\">Why programmers work at night</a>. I keep poking at it and doing minor things here and there when I have time, and it keeps selling. It&#8217;s still not finished, but it makes just enough sales a month to cover my Uber expenses.</p>\n<p>Which begs the question, why the hell am I still busting my arse freelancing?</p>\n<p>Well the money&#8217;s infinitely better, that&#8217;s true. And I don&#8217;t make enough from books to cover anything even close to my living expenses.</p>\n<p>But book revenue is additive. Freelancing revenue is linear.</p>\n<p>You see, no matter how much better I get at programming and getting clients, my revenue can only scale linearly. It&#8217;s bound by time and no matter how high my daily or weekly rate can go, there is only so much time. And I&#8217;m hitting a ceiling with my rate. And when I break this ceiling, a new one will be waiting just around the corner.</p>\n<p>With books &#8230; writing four to five a year would give me hockey stick growth.</p>\n<p>The d3.js book took me 332 hours. With a full-time writing schedule I can fit 6 of those into a year with no days off. With weekends and such I could easily write 5 technical books a year.</p>\n<p>On topics I don&#8217;t even know yet. It&#8217;s a magnificent way to learn, writing a book. That&#8217;s how the d3.js book happened. I had <em>no</em> clue about d3.js beforehand.</p>\n<p>But what about money?</p>\n<p>Well in its first quarter the book made €1019 of royalties. Second quarter, €676. Assuming a logarithmic fall towards a minimum, next quarter is going to be around 500, then 400 and so on.</p>\n<p>Eventually sales will reach an asymptotic limit and I&#8217;m going to get some €100 a quarter. Or €400 a year. By then it will have made me some €5000 or €6000, spread over some two years.</p>\n<p>Were I to write five books with similar sales every year I&#8217;d be making some €30,000 a year. Just enough to live like a normal person in Slovenia, or barely scrape by in a swanky place like <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"San Francisco\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7833333333,-122.416666667&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.7833333333,-122.416666667 (San%20Francisco)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">San Francisco</a>.</p>\n<p>But!</p>\n<p>This is where the hockey stick comes in. Because book revenue never falls to total zero, my yearly income would grow. Slowly at first, but by the time I was 50 I could live comfortably having done nothing but writing from now until then.</p>\n<p>If I started writing full-time <em>right now</em>, I could be making a living off writing in just two or three years. Maybe this is my next in the <a href=\"http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722\">11 lives you get</a>?</p>\n<p>After 17 years I&#8217;m getting kind of tired of programming anyway &#8230; anyone want to invest 90k in me becoming a full-time author?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c7206650-99fb-5e2a-8d27-376449757c9e"}}
