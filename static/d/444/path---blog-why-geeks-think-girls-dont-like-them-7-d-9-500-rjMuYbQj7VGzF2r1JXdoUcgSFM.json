But this particular story happened last night, to me.</p>\n<p>On my way home from class I went to a nearby coffee shop to read a book &#8211; it&#8217;s a trick I use to get myself off the internets and reading proper books that are awesome.</p>\n<p>Upon getting there, my regular spot, the only place with a good reading light, was occupied. Some girl was there, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Reading (process)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">reading a book</a>, minding her own business.</p>\n<p>I plomped my arse down at a nearby table and tried to read.Â There wasn&#8217;t enough light.</p>\n<p>After a few moments of thought I got up and asked the girl, if I could sit at her table because the light was better. She looked up from her book, smiled, said she doesn&#8217;t speak a word of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Slovene language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovene_language\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Slovene</a>, but that I should totally sit next to her since she&#8217;s hogging the only good light.</p>\n<p>Sat down, thinking <em>&#8220;My, that girl was kinda cute. Foreign too, I bet she&#8217;d be super interesting to talk to! Wonder what she&#8217;s doing here &#8230;&#8221;</em>Â And I started reading.</p>\n<p>After about half an hour, the girl stopped reading and just sort of sat there, looking kind of lost for a couple of minutes. I could almost <em>feel</em>Â her eyes peering through me &#8230; but the book was really interesting. I kept reading.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 377px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Bikofe\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/G2XU3IIWNOBNXBYGGLNXKAEFFSZFOVK4HEPG0WFYTMA2FHCB2.jpg\" alt=\"Bikofe\" width=\"367\" height=\"367\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bikofe</p></div>\n<p>She stood up and wandered about the coffee shop, looking at different things on the wall and just generally looking like a person loitering around waiting for someone to afford an opportunity to be spoken to.</p>\n<p>I was the only other person there.</p>\n<p>Finally she decided to leave. But before she did she came up to me, gave me a super warm smile and a cute good bye. All I did was a <em>Huh? Oh right, bye.</em></p>\n<p>Opportunity squandered.</p>\n<p>Here was a cute girl that would doubtlessly be really interesting to talk to, who actually <em>wanted</em>Â to talk to me. But I just didn&#8217;t give her a chance because I was there to read a book, damn it.</p>\n<p>I think this is something us geeks do <strong>a lot</strong>. We pride ourselves on our laser-focused minds, being able to <a title=\"Why programmers work at night\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198\">construct glass castles in our heads</a> when tackling big problems, but we often shut ourselves out of random opportunities &#8211; what people call <em>serendipity</em>.</p>\n<p>There was a line in my old startup pitch: <em>&#8220;<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Serendipity (film)\" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240890/\" rel=\"imdb\">Serendipity</a> is looking for a needle in a haystack and finding the farmer&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Except for engineers the line would be: <em>&#8220;Serendipity is looking for a needle in a haystack and finding the farmer&#8217;s daughter, then being pissed off that you couldn&#8217;t find the needle and going home without even saying Hello to the daughter.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s why the internet&#8217;s oldest joke is that geeks have never seen a girl.</p>\n<p>PS: this likely also has a lot to do with how different business-type founders are from engineer-type founders, that openness to random opportunities that pop up everywhere. Definitely something engineers should work on ðŸ™‚</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li-image zemanta-article-ul-li\" style=\"overflow: hidden; list-style: none; margin-top: 10px;\"><img style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 0; display: block; float: left;\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/787189897.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://berinkinsman.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/geekout-on-jason-and-the-argonauts/\">GeekOut on Jason and the Argonauts</a><span style=\"display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;\">(berinkinsman.wordpress.com)</span>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\n<hr style=\"margin: 0;\" />\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li-image zemanta-article-ul-li\" style=\"overflow: hidden; list-style: none; margin-top: 10px;\"><img style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 0; display: block; float: left;\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/786798097.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/03/books-to-read-to-kids/\">Books Geeks Should Read to Their Kids: Your Additions to Our List</a><span style=\"display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;\">(wired.com)</span>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\n<hr style=\"margin: 0;\" />\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li-image zemanta-article-ul-li\" style=\"overflow: hidden; list-style: none; margin-top: 10px;\"><img style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 0; display: block; float: left;\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/787447587.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/05/the-worlds-first-steampunk-bedtime-story/&amp;a=78744758&amp;rid=867f674b-7187-44ee-8f19-618550443921&amp;e=ee6f5798c6cc490b9a4a4724e57d38bb\">First steampunk bedtime story</a><span style=\"display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;\">(geekout.blogs.cnn.com)</span>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\n<hr style=\"margin: 0;\" />\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li-image zemanta-article-ul-li\" style=\"overflow: hidden; list-style: none; margin-top: 10px;\"><img style=\"padding: 0; margin: 0 10px 10px 0; border: 0; display: block; float: left;\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/675183767.jpg\" alt=\"\" /><a style=\"display: block;\" href=\"http://nerdgasmnoire.wordpress.com/2011/12/10/blessed-are-the-geek-for-they-shall-inherit-the-earth/\">&#8220;Blessed are the geek, for they shall inherit the earth.&#8221;</a><span style=\"display: block; font-size: 12px; margin: 10px 0 10px 0;\">(nerdgasmnoire.wordpress.com)</span>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\">\n<hr style=\"margin: 0;\" />\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=867f674b-7187-44ee-8f19-618550443921\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d38ab772-f4be-5a58-a299-4504f2ca0e73"}}
