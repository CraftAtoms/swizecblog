{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Firefox 3.0 release party","content":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.kiberpipa.org/firefox/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Firefox release event\">firefox 3 release event</a>  happened this Tuesday and I would&#39;ve blogged about it yesterday were it not for some people&#39;s stupid keyboards that I swear were not meant to be typed on.</p>\n<p>It went on at <a href=\"http://www.kiberpipa.org/\" title=\"Kiberpipa\">kiberpipa</a>  and was rather well organised for such an event, was pleasantly surprised. Everything started off with a talk from <a href=\"http://standblog.org/blog/\">Tristan Nitot</a>  about how Firefox came about and why it&#39;s managed to strive so much. He spoke of interesting things I haven&#39;t even thought of before, but it was all a bit dragged out if you ask me and it showed that he wasn&#39;t very well prepared (in fact he admited to having finished the presentation six minutes after he was scheduled to give it).</p>\n<p>Unluckily, though, it was a bit too hot for my liking and I didn&#39;t want to sweat my life away there so the other presentations escaped me since I went home to have a shower. But I&#39;m certain they were very interesting and informative.</p>\n<p>Later on I came to the party where I got the rest of my free stuff (all together a t-shirt from the event, firefox wine and a notebook, awesome) and mingled a bit with the people. Didn&#39;t know very many of them, but at least the food was bloody awesome. Nice of them to have thought of feeding us &#8230; unlike blogres you know &#8230;</p>\n<p>When I noticed <a href=\"http://standblog.org/blog/\">Tristan</a>  was a bit removed from everyone else I went to implore about why Opera wasn&#39;t shown on any of the graphs in his presentation and he mentioned that the time has come when FF finally beats Opera in certain performance aspects &#8211; interesting stuff, will have to try. Also, interestingly, he also reads xkcd and recognised my t-shirt as being from there.</p>\n<p>Sadly I left the party after an hour because I was melting my life away. </p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"39ade08e-e252-5072-962f-32417e778d85"}}
