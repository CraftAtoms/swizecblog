{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Edgar Allan Poe was 200 yesterday","content":"<p>Most of you probably don&#8217;t realise but Mr. Poe had his 200th birthday yesterday, which is a once in a lifetime event &#8230; or for him a once in a post mortem event &#8230; so I decided to at least raise a glass of cognac to his genius, if I can&#8217;t afford a trip to Boston. Air travel ticket prices bloody suck if you ask me, a three day trip to my favourite poet&#8217;s birthday party would cost upwards of a thousand euro just to get there and back. Let alone staying there for three days.</p>\n<p>The most surprising thing about cognac was that it&#8217;s extremely expensive. I mean, 18 euro for a glass? What the fuck!? But I was assured it was a really good cognac with a bottle costing several hundred euro and since it was Poe&#8217;s birthday I decided to have the glass anyhow. Poor student and all.</p>\n<p>Cognac, some Remy Martin thing, was absolutely divine! I loved it. The taste was lovably soft and gentle, the smell was magnificent and I loved the whole experience. However I wish I could have the cognac over Poe&#8217;s grave and &#8220;talk&#8221; to him about how much of an inspiration he&#8217;s been to me over the years and how I&#8217;ve read most of his works at least twice.</p>\n<p>As a bit of trivia, did you know that every year on Poe&#8217;s birthday a misterious man nobody knows leaves a bottle of cognac and a glass on Poe&#8217;s grave? I&#8217;ve always found that very intriguing.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"067f68f3-8ecf-5ff1-be09-895e1c6628f2"}}
