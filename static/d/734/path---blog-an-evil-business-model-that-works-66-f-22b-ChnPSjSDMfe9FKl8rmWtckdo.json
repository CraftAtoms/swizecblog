The main product locks them in, the auxilary product bleeds them dry.</p>\n<h2>Good old bait and switch.</h2>\n<p>While gaming consoles are a pretty tame rip off and printers matter less and less. The razor blade industry is actively ripping off half the population! (assuming women mostly depilate, rather than shave)</p>\n<p>As mammals who like to pretend they aren&#8217;t hairy beasts, everyone must shave. At least once in a while. As a result the <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/2329747/Why-the-shaving-market-is-so-cut-throat\" target=\"_blank\">male shaving industry is worth <strong>$2,000,000,000</strong> in the US alone</a>.</p>\n<p>First you buy a razor handle, cheap, I promise, later you have to buy replacement razor blades. You know, for a clean smooth shave! Price? Oh, just twice as much as the original purchase, no biggie!</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s evil.</p>\n<p>Forget Google stealing all your datas or <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/digital-culture/social-networking/twitter-sells-your-feed-to-big-data/article2355287/\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter selling you out to advertisers</a>. Here, you <em>pay</em> to be ripped off. <em>Pay!</em></p>\n<p>Dealing with the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Shaving\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">shaving</a> industry has become so horrible I would rather shave with so old a razor that shaving sounds like a snow shovel scraping against asphalt. <em>HRRRRKKKKHHRHK!</em></p>\n<div style=\"width: 360px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" \" title=\"30 euro :/\" src=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m1fo0fZON41qekjngo1_500.jpg\" alt=\"30 euro :/\" width=\"350\" height=\"468\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">30 euro :/</p></div>\n<p>The handle on my last one even broke &#8211; pressing too hard made the whole thing fly off! Kept using it for two months.</p>\n<p>When you finally say to yourself <em>&#8220;Okay, this is getting ridiculous, I&#8217;m buying replacement razors&#8221;</em> &#8230; you go to a store and are presented with a fine selection of two or three types of razors.</p>\n<p>None match what you&#8217;ve got at home.</p>\n<p>You go to the next store &#8230; the situation isn&#8217;t much better.</p>\n<p>Rinse and repeat about five times and the realization finally hits you &#8211; you&#8217;ve been using this razor so long it&#8217;s been discontinued and you have to buy a whole new set.</p>\n<p>Well, fuck.</p>\n<h2>Volunteering for a rip off</h2>\n<p>After mulling over three blades, or five, aloe this strip, silky smooth rubber that strip, maye I should just get a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Razor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">disposable razor</a> &#8230; you finally pick something that looks like it might work. You fork over the 10 euro for a new razor and then 20 euro for a set of replacement blades &#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230; and you vow not to make another purchase for at least a year. You&#8217;d rather suffer using the same blade for two or three months.</p>\n<p>No considerations of brand loyalty, no recollection of any marketing you saw on television, no other consideration than minimizing exposure to the purchase. When buying a computer all you want is an <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"List of Intel microprocessors\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_microprocessors\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Intel processor</a> and a Nvidia graphics card. If it&#8217;s portable and you can afford it, you want an Apple.</p>\n<p>And you cherish the purchase. You get excited when you buy something!</p>\n<p>With razor blades just walking into the store makes you feel ripped off.</p>\n<p>Maybe if they worked on that, they could get me in the store more often and increase the whole market &#8211; not just market share &#8211; would get bigger.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/shaving-company-kickstarts-business-with-hilarious-viral-video/\" target=\"_blank\">Shaving company kickstarts business with hilarious viral video</a> (digitaltrends.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www2.macleans.ca/2012/03/20/shaving-sticker-shock-off-razors/\" target=\"_blank\">The Dollar Shave Club&#8217;s pitch is smooth, and razor sharp</a> (macleans.ca)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://pandodaily.com/2012/03/06/dollar-shave-club-punches-gillette-where-it-hurts-in-the-marketing-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">Dollar Shave Club Punches Gillette Where It Hurts.
