{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"I&#8217;m a pro blogger now!","content":"<p>Late January <a href=\"http://twitter.com/andraz\" target=\"_blank\">@andraz</a> approached me with an idea: What if I helped <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Zemanta</a> spruce up <a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/fruitblog/\" target=\"_blank\">their tech blog</a>?</p>\n<p>The blog had been languishing in neglect for a long time. An update every couple of months, completely random and with no real direction or purpose. Since they&#8217;re a company that&#8217;s all about <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Blog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog\" rel=\"wikipedia\">blogging</a> I guess it didn&#8217;t look good to have a dead blog on their domain &#8230;</p>\n<p>Now, I&#8217;d never blogged professionally and the whole prospect seemed a bit scary at first. It&#8217;s one thing to arse about on your own blog and something completely different to ask for money and then be at a loss for words.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3798\" style=\"width: 774px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/a_stats.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3798 \" title=\"Post stats\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/a_stats.png\" alt=\"Post stats\" width=\"764\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/a_stats.png 955w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/a_stats-300x58.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 764px) 100vw, 764px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Post stats</p></div>\n<p>The arrangement is pretty simple: Zemanta provides cool stories &#8211; I write two posts a month and whore them out on appropriate social networks.</p>\n<p>Two posts so far and everything went better than expected!</p>\n<p>The first got about four thousand pageviews to a blog that was previously getting ten people a day. The second post got about <strong>15,000</strong>!  Smashing success! And I actually think the score could be a lot higher had their server not melted.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t easy though, each of those posts took four to five hours of research and writing &#8211; and that&#8217;s not even counting the work it took to build my writing to where it doesn&#8217;t smack people in the face and make them leave (too much)</p>\n<p>But the research is most fun!</p>\n<p>I get free range to pick developer&#8217;s brains, pretend I understand what the hell they&#8217;re talking about, then spend hours getting up to speed online and in the end dump that research into a story. And it does have to be a story!</p>\n<p>Nobody wants to read a dry technology report &#8230; well, some do, but they aren&#8217;t deterred by a good story &#8230; And there&#8217;s just enough Thompson in my blogging that I keep referring to Zemanta in the third person on their own blog; which looks a bit weird.</p>\n<p>Honestly, it just makes me giggle like a school girl that anyone would <em>pay</em> me to write blogs. It&#8217;s marvelous!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://mommabethyname.com/2012/02/01/come-visit-me-at-zemanta/\">Come Visit Me at Zemanta</a> (mommabethyname.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dialogueofprayers.wordpress.com/2011/12/01/chrome-and-zemanta/\">Chrome and Zemanta</a> (dialogueofprayers.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/blog/is-zemanta-your-little-blogging-secret/\">Is Zemanta your little blogging secret?</a> (zemanta.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d4dd2885-f909-4e8e-af7b-37a55dd1cf1e\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6c6a8c75-159f-58b0-9e57-92faf03bc2f3"}}
