Even when the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Idea\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">idea</a> <strong><em>is</em></strong>Â yours, there is a lot that goes into coming up with a decent post.</p>\n<p>Let me describe the two ways I write.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Meadow_near_Gard%27s_Farm_-_geograph.org.uk_-_896805.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Meadow near Gard's Farm Taken from the bridlew...\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/20/Meadow_near_Gard%27s_Farm_-_geograph.org.uk_-_896805.jpg/300px-Meadow_near_Gard%27s_Farm_-_geograph.org.uk_-_896805.jpg\" alt=\"Meadow near Gard's Farm Taken from the bridlew...\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meadow near Gard&#39;s Farm Taken from the bridleway most of the foreground is in this square the rest of the field in the next.

The only post of this sort that has ever reached popularity was <em><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/living-life-in-25min-increments/swizec/1859\">Living life in 25 min increments</a>.</em></p>\n<h2>&#8220;not my&#8221; post</h2>\n<p>More often than not, you can&#8217;t write a post the moment you think of it. You&#8217;re either too busy, the idea hasn&#8217;t fully formed in your head, or it just isn&#8217;t the right type of idea for a particular day.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seven_Sisters_snow_sunset.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Sunset behind the remaining three of Bristol's...\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Seven_Sisters_snow_sunset.jpg/300px-Seven_Sisters_snow_sunset.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset behind the remaining three of Bristol's...\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sunset behind the remaining three of Bristol&#39;s &quot;Seven Sisters&quot;. (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>\n<p>Sometimes the idea does come from outside &#8211; like when somebody from <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Zemanta</a> comes up to me and goes <em>&#8220;Hey, I think you should write about this. And if you could also make product X look good, that&#8217;d be great&#8221;</em>. Or sometimes it&#8217;s a friend saying <em>&#8220;Hey, I just launched this cool thing/solved this cool problem/did something awesome &#8230; can you write about it?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The idea goes on the whiteboard. Or in a moleskine. Anywhere.</p>\n<p>Yesterday I wrote a post for Zemanta (to be published later today). Â Here&#8217;s what the process looked like:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;Hey, write about This Thing &#8482;.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Install product, promise to give it a try</li>\n<li>3 days go by when I&#8217;m busy with other stuff</li>\n<li>&#8220;Hey, did you write anything yet? Just checking.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Check out product, look at its homepage</li>\n<li>Go to bed thinking about the post</li>\n<li>Wake up, do an hour and a half<em>Â </em>of research on an unknown <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Problem domain\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_domain\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">problem domain</a></li>\n<li>Go to class</li>\n<li>Ruminate on the post all day</li>\n<li>Come up with a few key phrases and points to mention</li>\n<li>Start writing &#8230; decide I still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m writing about</li>\n<li>Jot down three main points, organize them in a flow</li>\n<li>Spend two hours writing a <em>very</em>Â crappy draft</li>\n<li>Watch an episode of futurama</li>\n<li>Rewrite the whole post in 20 minutes</li>\n<li>Congratulations, it is now 1:19am.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>While yesterday was a particularly crappy because I haven&#8217;t been getting enough off-time lately, that&#8217;s pretty much what goes into writing the kind of post that reliably makes it to The Frontpage &#8482;.</p>\n<p>Several rewrites from <em>Wtf am I doing</em>Â to <em>Hey, I can publish this &#8230;</em>Â Each step also needs at least 20 minutes of slacking off before taking the next step.</p>\n<p>But I think it&#8217;s worth it.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is why the quality of my posts usually dips whenever a bunch of work is dumped in my lap. Double so if a deadline is attached to everything.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.contentmarketinginstitute.com/2012/02/federated-media-bloggers/\" target=\"_blank\">Federated, Zemanta Launch Program to Connect Bloggers with Brands</a> (contentmarketinginstitute.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.bloggingtips.com/2012/04/04/grow-a-blog-in-30-days/\" target=\"_blank\">Grow A Blog In 30 Days &#8211; One Simple Idea Spark Up Your Blog!</a> (bloggingtips.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ayeshazahid.com/2012/04/04/inexperiencedor-youre-learning/\" target=\"_blank\">inexperienced(or you&#8217;re learning)</a> (ayeshazahid.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.factbrowser.com/2012/02/22/free-tools-to-make-blogging-easier/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Free tools That Make Blogging So Much Easier</a> (factbrowser.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/media/2012/04/beauty-and-post-postbag-journalism\" target=\"_blank\">Beauty and post-postbag journalism</a> (newstatesman.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://scarvesandcigarettes.wordpress.com/2012/04/02/ive-been-posting-these-in-the-wrong-blog/\" target=\"_blank\">I&#8217;ve been posting these in the wrong blog&#8230;</a> (scarvesandcigarettes.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=e6f46b5b-f41f-4e3b-a5de-161e3361ed67\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"08c1cc8c-ff29-5925-b9ab-43ad85081945"}}
