A little more than twice as much in fact, but there&#8217;re two more weeks of April.</p>\n<p>The beginning of September still feels the effects of a launch. Sales are high.

Otherwise, it&#8217;s going to slip beyond the point of no return, and nobody wants that.

Not bad, not spectacular. The lack of growth is worrying, but there&#8217;s a lot of things I could do about that. Use the mailing list to drive traffic instead of audience relationship, do more to re-share old content, run ads, better SEO tricks, etc.</p>\n<p>When you switch to a monthly view, you see a slight downward trend. <em>However</em>, over the past 3 years, traffic follows what could be the slow ramp up towards an exponential curve.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8334\" style=\"width: 2216px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8334\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-year-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Blog traffic from Apr 2015 to Apr 2018\" width=\"2206\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-year-screenshot.png 2206w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-year-screenshot-300x58.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-year-screenshot-768x149.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3-year-screenshot-1024x199.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2206px) 100vw, 2206px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Blog traffic from Apr 2015 to Apr 2018</p></div>\n<p>Traffic went from 5,000 pageviews per week in April 2015 to 20,000 in April 2018.
