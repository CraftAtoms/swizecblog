But not just any chatroom. Oh no, itâ€™s a hacker haven. A chatroom that you can only get into if you <a href=\"http://school.shoutem.com/lectures/chat-app-firebase-redux-react-native/\">follow my React Native tutorial</a>, and build the app, and run it in a simulator.</p>\n<p>Or if you write an HTML clone.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec\">@Swizec</a> Phase 1 complete ?? <a href=\"https://t.co/3nj1tQP8pE\">pic.twitter.com/3nj1tQP8pE</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Luke Edwards (@lukeed05) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukeed05/status/844651989715726336\">March 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>And you thought IRC was hard for not-nerds to figure out. Ha! ? My global chatroom is <em>exclusive</em>.</p>\n<p>I launched the chatroom at 10am on Tuesday. The tutorial went out, the social posts went out, I fired up my simulator, and then I waited. Like a spider in disguise. Or a fly waiting to be eaten ?</p>\n<p>Seven hours later, at 1 minute and 8 seconds past 5pm, somebody said <em>&quot;Howdy&quot;</em>. It worked! I asked the internet for lulz and the internet lulzed! ??</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">IT HAPPENED SOMEONE SAID HELLO IN THE GLOBAL CHATROOM!

Nine hours exposed to the internet, available for anyone to say anything <em>anonymously</em>. The worst that happened was that somebody said &quot;ass&quot;.</p>\n<p>Faith in humanity restored! The internet is clean and pure. ?</p>\n<p>It got more interesting on Wednesday. Some more people came in to say hello. This time they pretended to be me.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7512\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/screenshot1.png\" width=\"537\" height=\"763\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/screenshot1.png 537w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/screenshot1-211x300.png 211w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 537px) 100vw, 537px\" />\n<p>React Native <code>&lt;Text&gt;</code> doesn&#39;t render backslashes.

Busy like the public bazaar of an old village in Siberia.</p>\n<p>6 people came to say hello.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7511\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/users-screenshot.png\" width=\"913\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/users-screenshot.png 913w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/users-screenshot-300x123.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/users-screenshot-768x315.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" />\n<p>That&#39;s a lot for a place that only exists as an unpublished app.</p>\n<p>And then, just as it had started, the fun was over. Firebase sent an automated message saying that we were done. That you can&#39;t just run a public chatroom by sharing Firebase account credentials with everyone. That we&#39;re abusing the system and that we should find better things to do.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So that was fun while it lasted <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ChatApp?src=hash\">#ChatApp</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0NU5NqBWah\">pic.twitter.com/0NU5NqBWah</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/844649016294039554\">March 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>I went into the Firebase console, found the link, copy pasted into the browser and</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>?</p>\n<p>The internet is a beautiful place.</p>\n<p>My experiment is going ridiculously well.
