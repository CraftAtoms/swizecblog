{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"NaN does not equal NaN","content":"<p>For the second time today I noticed someone on twitter berating javascript over this little connundrum:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\r\n> NaN == NaN\r\nfalse\r\n> NaN === NaN\r\nfalse\r\n> NaN !== NaN\r\ntrue\r\n></pre>\n<p>Counterintuitively, it would seem that NaN does not equal NaN.Â But let&#8217;s think about this for a second. Is it really that strange or just a symptom of what the logical symbol NaN actually stands for?</p>\n<p>Thing is, NaN stands for &#8220;Not a Number&#8221; and if memory serves comes right out of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"IEEE 754-2008\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-2008\" rel=\"wikipedia\">IEEE754</a> <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Floating point\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point\" rel=\"wikipedia\">floating point arithmetic</a>. It&#8217;s very handy for representing things like 0/0, different kinds of infinity and operations involving infinities. In short, it represents an <em>undefinable number</em>.</p>\n<p>Now, what could possibly be the result of comparing two undefinable numbers?</p>\n<p>Mathematically, I have no idea what the result should be &#8230; probably something we simply agreed upon? Like how the 0th power is 1. But in my naive understanding of these things it should produce random results. However, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"JavaScript\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" rel=\"wikipedia\">JavaScript</a> is kind enough to always claim that NaN does not equal NaN, if for naught else than to remind us we are trying to do something stupid.</p>\n<p>Can anyone tell me if other languages handle this differently? Just produce an error of some sort?</p>\n<p>Also, please share this post with your local JavaScript newbie, I die a little every time I see that sort of tweet.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=fef0bbc6-0acd-4e80-b24d-0faea5e230f1\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"beaca45c-0148-5aec-ab58-18eca34f1e63"}}
