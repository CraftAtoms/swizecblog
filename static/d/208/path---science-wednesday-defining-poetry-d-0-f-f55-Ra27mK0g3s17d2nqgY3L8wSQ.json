Answering the question &#8220;Is this art?&#8221; is impossible, so Manurung came up with a better definition of poetry in his doctorate thesis <em><a href=\"http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Paper/2348039.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">An evolutionary algorithm for poetry generation</a>.</em></p>\n<p>He touches upon three dimensions of poetry: poeticness, grammaticality and meaningfulness and finally arrives at a useful definition.</p>\n<h2>Poeticness</h2>\n<p>Usual suspect properties of poetry apply here, exactly the ones you learned about in high school. Things such as rhythm, metre, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Phoneme\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">phonemic</a> patterns and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Literal and figurative language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_and_figurative_language\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">figurative language</a>.</p>\n<p>For our experiments to be falsifiable it is useful to focus solely on the technical aspects of poetry i.e. the rhythm and phonemic patterns. If you don&#8217;t remember &#8211; rhythm and metre are the patterns in syllable stress and phonemic patterns are rhymes and such.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_4084\" style=\"width: 409px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/metre.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-4084\" title=\"Ambiguity in partitioning metre into feet\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/metre.png\" alt=\"Ambiguity in partitioning metre into feet\" width=\"399\" height=\"174\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/metre.png 399w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/metre-300x130.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 399px) 100vw, 399px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ambiguity in partitioning metre into feet</p></div>\n<p>There are several types of phonemic patterns (rhyme, alliteration, assonance and consonance), but considering the syllabication problem solved, these are fairly easy to test.</p>\n<p>Problems arise when considering figurative language. When is something a metaphor, or just using the wrong word? Quinn (1982) lists a taxonomy of 60 different types of figures of speech, both at the symbolic and the rhetorical level. (can&#8217;t find a link right now, sorry)</p>\n<p>This is a poem produced by an old-style system using purely random functions (ELUAR).</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sparkles of whiteness fly in my eyes,<br />\nThe moan of stars swang branches of trees,<br />\nThe heart of time sings in the snowy night.<br />\nSeconds of Eternity fly in grass,<br />\nThe Clock of rain turns,<br />\nDeath of the Apples,<br />\nThe Equinox penetrates the words.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Is it a real poem? I don&#8217;t know, but the experiment doesn&#8217;t look very falsifiable either.</p>\n<p>Any <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Surrealist techniques\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_techniques\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">automatic poetry</a> generator bumps into the problem that <em>Readers of [poetry] are prepared to do considerable interpretative work &#8230; In general, the more the audience is prepared to contribute in responding to a work of art, themore chance there is that a computer&#8217;s performance may be acknowledged as aesthetically valuable (Boden 1990)</em></p>\n<p>The implication being &#8220;this shit is simple&#8221;. But that&#8217;s abusing the concept of poetic license &#8211; something we want to avoid and make life harder for ourselves.</p>\n<h2>Grammaticality</h2>\n<blockquote><p>A poem must obey linguistic conventions that are prescribed by a given grammar and lexicon. This is perhaps the most obvious requirement that by definition all natural lan- guage artifacts should fulfill. However, in the context of poetry, it is important to state explicitly, as there is the danger of invoking poetic license (see previous section).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, we are avoiding purely random strings of words.</p>\n<p>For instance: according to <em>hyperbaton </em>(a defined figure of speech) the line &#8220;I was in my life alone&#8221; is allowed, but &#8220;In I life was alone my&#8221; is just silly.</p>\n<h2>Meaningfulness</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 196px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/22179411@N06/4236215697\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Poetry is an...\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2523/4236215697_595587b794_m.jpg\" alt=\"Poetry is an...\" width=\"186\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Poetry is an... (Photo credit: liber(the poet);)</p></div>\n<p>Simply put, the property of meaningfulness states that a text must <em>intentionally</em> convey some sort of conceptual message that can be interpreted. This holds true for any <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Natural language generation\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Natural Language Generation</a> system and despite what first year english majors might think, it must also hold true for poetry.</p>\n<p>Keyword being <em>intentionally</em>. The above poem produced by ELUAR primarily hinges on unguided random processes, so it cannot possibly fulfill this requirement.</p>\n<h2>Useful definition</h2>\n<p>Finally we reach a useful definition of poetry:</p>\n<blockquote><p>A poem is a natural language artifact which simultaneously fulfills the properties of meaningfulness, grammaticality and poeticness. In other words, a text x is a poem if x ∈ P ∩ G ∩ M.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For this definition to be complete, further specification must be done on defining meaningfulness and poeticness &#8211; something I hope the authors have published papers on since 2003, otherwise this is an area I hope to tackle in my thesis.</p>\n<p>Since we can measure the technical aspects of poeticness, this definition favors classical poetry &#8211; a good thing, since I personally have always found modern poetry to be somewhat contrived in its desperate attempts to be <em>art</em>.</p>\n<p>Greeting card poetry serves as a good example of poetry fitting our definition.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Far and away you may be,<br />\nBut the presence of your love is here with me</p></blockquote>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://juliecatherinevigna.wordpress.com/2012/03/25/new-index-of-poems/\" target=\"_blank\">New: Index of Poems</a> (juliecatherinevigna.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/science-wednesday-towards-a-computational-model-of-poetry-generation/swizec/3855\" target=\"_blank\">Science Wednesday: Towards a computational model of poetry generation</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://cgdelarey.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/poetry-in-motion/\" target=\"_blank\">Poetry in motion</a> (cgdelarey.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://caterpillartooth.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/explore-poetry-in-april/\" target=\"_blank\">Explore Poetry in April</a> (caterpillartooth.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://haikulovesongs.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/celebrating-the-amazing-poets-behind-one-stop-poetry-redux/\" target=\"_blank\">celebrating the amazing poets behind One Stop Poetry {redux}</a> (haikulovesongs.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alchemyofscrawl.wordpress.com/2012/03/24/guest-post-by-g-p-a-spoken-word-is-not-poetry/\" target=\"_blank\">Guest Post by G.P.A &#8211; Spoken Word is not Poetry</a> (alchemyofscrawl.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://rainingink.wordpress.com/2012/03/27/foundblack-out-poetry-tuesday-2/\" target=\"_blank\">Found/Black Out Poetry Tuesday: Emotions and Sharp Edges</a> (rainingink.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d0ed91b7-a024-40cd-a4be-b140b8c40391\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"37bc1dec-1231-5877-be94-e2551412bf9e"}}
