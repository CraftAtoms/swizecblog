Everyone who RSVP&#8217;d managed to make it despite the impending holidays next day.</p>\n<p>Surprising how difficult it is to count people calmly sitting in place and not moving. I&#8217;d make a terrible guardian for children on a fieldtrip, but there were somewhere between 38 and 47 people based on my various counts.</p>\n<p>All the speakers did a great job of presenting their topics and I was happy to see next to no smartphone and laptop <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Omphaloskepsis\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphaloskepsis\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">navel gazing</a> from the audience. Rare sight at these sorts of events.</p>\n<p>We learned about writing performant JavaScript, where the biggest challenge is maintaining performance across browsers and devices. Apparently writing performant JavaScript for Chrome on a quad core desktop monster is much easier than a four year old smartphone running an outdated version of Android.</p>\n<p>Then it was straight to an overview of using modern MV* libraries and the difference between frameworks and libraries &#8211; a library is fairly open-minded and a framework is smarter than you so you have to obey.</p>\n<p>The talk about <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"AngularJS\" href=\"http://www.angularjs.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">AngularJS</a> deepened the subject by showing a few code examples with AngularJS. Looks like it&#8217;s very easy to magically connect things on the screen, but step out of what Angular knows is best and you will have a bad time and likely way too much work.</p>\n<p>In the end, the talk about <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"TypeScript\" href=\"http://www.typescriptlang.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">TypeScript</a> explained what it looks like when you port Java to JavaScript. The most interesting part for me was observing the difference in style preferences. I honestly don&#8217;t think TypeScript looks better than just using JavaScript &#8230;</p>\n<p>Either way, the videos are now online.
