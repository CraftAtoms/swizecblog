I never knew him personally and yet I feel like writing a post about his death before even getting out of bed this morning. When I went to bed last night, he wasn&#8217;t dead yet, this morning, he was.</p>\n<p>Interesting how much can change in the world when you fall asleep for six hours. And people say sleep isn&#8217;t a waste of time &#8230;</p>\n<p>Sure, it was readily apparent that Steve Jobs would eventually die,  not only is he just a man despite what many would like to believe, he also suffered from cancer and was visibly growing weaker over the past few years.</p>\n<p>A lot of people will remember him for being a great entrepreneur, many will think that it&#8217;s really cool he could build two epic startups, create Pixar and then fix up his first startup into one of the most legendary technology companies currently in existence.</p>\n<p>But none of that really matters, his biggest impact on the world is simply being <em>very fucking inspirational.</em> I will remember him most for the speech he held at Stanford in 2005.</p>\n<p><object width=\"640\" height=\"360\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UF8uR6Z6KLc&amp;rel=0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><embed width=\"640\" height=\"360\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UF8uR6Z6KLc&amp;rel=0&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;version=3\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" allowScriptAccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" /></object></p>\n<p>There are other important quotes by him and I&#8217;m sure the internet will be full of them for the next few days so I&#8217;m not going to post any.</p>\n<p>Just remember: stay foolish.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.marketingheadhunter.com/2011/10/steve-jobs-dont-settle.html\">STEVE JOBS: &#8220;Don&#8217;t settle.&#8221;</a> (marketingheadhunter.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://shawketali.wordpress.com/2011/10/06/remembering-steve-jobs/\">Remembering Steve Jobs</a> (shawketali.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504803_162-20116402-10391709.html\">&#8220;60 Minutes&#8221;: The Steve Jobs interviews</a> (cbsnews.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=b0a358a0-e66c-4d3d-85af-bbed23da5556\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2cf1e74c-9741-5406-ae99-ba6168da4370"}}
