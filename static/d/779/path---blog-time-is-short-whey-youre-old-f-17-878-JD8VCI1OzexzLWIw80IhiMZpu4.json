Are two weeks seriously this short when you&#8217;re old? Shorter? But at least I&#8217;m having a bit of a good time, which I&#8217;m sure is more than many people can say.</p>\n<p>To be honest, I&#8217;ve been feeling a dash uninspired writing-wise ever since my dear Merrick died more than a week ago. Her graphics card went bezerk and there was nothing I could do. Wanted to replace the broken thing myself just so it&#8217;d be over with quickly, but alas, portable Macs don&#8217;t use a graphics card per se, but a graphics chip and some memory right on the motherboard.</p>\n<p>This makes me sad.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s worse is that Merrick was my happy fun times computer so most of my passing entertainment like, say, RSS readers and whatnot, are there. Sure, there&#8217;s a backup, but it&#8217;s just not the same, not the same at all. I can&#8217;t well read RSS feeds and blogs on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lestat de Lioncourt\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lestat_de_Lioncourt\">Lestat</a> the big fancy desktop computer. Just feels wrong! He&#8217;s for work and fancy graphic effects and HD video and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"MSN\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN\">MSN</a> and dust collecting.</p>\n<p>And so, without his trusty entertainment and constant twitter stream, our hapless hero is feeling old and betrayed and with the latest intelectual property debacle just a little bit raped and abusde. His answer? Fuck it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m investing a large portion of my savings in gold by the way, not looking for profits, just looking for retained <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Purchasing power\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power\">buying power</a> and that&#8217;s what gold seems to excel at. The gold broker I met with today also felt quite awesome and gave me a good gut feeling about the whole thing so I&#8217;m rather psyched about this.</p>\n<p>Gooooold.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Zemified by Zemanta\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/2631de0c-386d-4b3c-a178-7fe90bccaede/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=2631de0c-386d-4b3c-a178-7fe90bccaede\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e7a16d80-8107-55d9-9bf0-1bc3c4213cd4"}}
