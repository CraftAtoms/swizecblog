Turns out there was no <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/culture_shock\" title=\"Culture shock\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock\">culture shock</a> to speak of.</p>\n<p>Apparently if you watch enough movies and television, or just if you watch as much as I do, the US turns out to be a pretty unsurprising country to visit. I had more surprises visiting the <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/united_kingdom\" title=\"United Kingdom\" rel=\"geolocation\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5,-0.116666666667&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=51.5,-0.116666666667 (United%20Kingdom)&amp;t=h\">UK</a> or <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/italy\" title=\"Italy\" rel=\"geolocation\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=41.9,12.4833333333&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=41.9,12.4833333333 (Italy)&amp;t=h\">Italy</a> and they&#8217;re practically neighbours.</p>\n<p>Everything is just as you&#8217;d expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the roads are incredibly wide</li>\n<li>the roads have way too many lanes</li>\n<li>the cars are stupidly big</li>\n<li>everything is insanely cheap</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last point in particular was quite surprising. The US markets itself as the land of plenty, the land of supple opportunity and the land of the rich. Well, from a European&#8217;s point of view, the US is pretty much a big <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/discount_store\" title=\"Discount store\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discount_store\">discount store</a>. You enter the country and <em>everything</em> is sold at roughly a 30% to 40% discount depending on the day.</p>\n<p>And the cheapening effect doesn&#8217;t stop at the Dollar vs. Euro dynamic. Because of the bigger economy and cheap labor (I imagine) stuff is just cheaper in general. For example a sushi lunch in <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/ljubljana\" title=\"Ljubljana\" rel=\"geolocation\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.0513888889,14.5055555556&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=46.0513888889,14.5055555556 (Ljubljana)&amp;t=h\">Ljubljana</a> would cost three times as much as it did in the US, while being at least half smaller.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s pretty insane.</p>\n<p>Or like I bought a pair of jeans at a pretty reasonable price and upon getting home my sister tells me what I bought was one of the top brands super-expensive type of jeans. O.o</p>\n<p>Ok, so I guess there&#8217;s a bit of culture shock. The cheapness of everything.</p>\n<p>There were, however, a few more odd little tidbits that I noticed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>americans aren&#8217;t as fat as you&#8217;d think, on average they&#8217;re quite europe-like</li>\n<li>all doors open the wrong way (fire safety or something)</li>\n<li>there is a severe lack of automatic doors everywhere</li>\n<li>some stores still give you hand-written receipts</li>\n<li>very few stores have modern computer-like cash registers</li>\n<li>almost nobody takes <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/debit_card\" title=\"Debit card\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card\">debit cards</a> as payment</li>\n<li>all store clerks are SOOPER nice, it was surprising</li>\n<li>a lot of &#8220;natives&#8221; don&#8217;t speak english</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That&#8217;s about it, I should write some more about the actual startup scene, the companies we visited and what we&#8217;ve seen of the US from that perspective; but that&#8217;s best reserved for Preona&#8217;s company blog.</p>\n<p>Oh and while I did go see <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/alcatraz_island\" title=\"Alcatraz Island\" rel=\"geolocation\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.8264,-122.4224&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=37.8264,-122.4224 (Alcatraz%20Island)&amp;t=h\">Alcatraz</a> and it was very fucking incredibly rainy that day, I didn&#8217;t get to see the Golden Gate Bridge, which is just stupid. But anyways, here are some random pics from my shiny new iPhone4.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fswiz%2Fsets%2F72157625288084730%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fswiz%2Fsets%2F72157625288084730%2F&amp;set_id=72157625288084730&amp;jump_to=\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/apps/slideshow/show.swf?v=71649\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" flashvars=\"offsite=true&amp;lang=en-us&amp;page_show_url=%2Fphotos%2Fswiz%2Fsets%2F72157625288084730%2Fshow%2F&amp;page_show_back_url=%2Fphotos%2Fswiz%2Fsets%2F72157625288084730%2F&amp;set_id=72157625288084730&amp;jump_to=\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>PS: Cheesecake Factory has the best fucking cheesecake (or cake in general) that I have ever had the pleasure of tasting!</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=b11e33c7-9113-4266-9831-ea91b28c7758\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f559e454-693d-5ef8-8bc4-9bed39e00d91"}}
