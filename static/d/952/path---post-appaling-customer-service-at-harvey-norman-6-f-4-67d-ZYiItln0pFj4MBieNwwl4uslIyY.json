At first I had to wait quite a while for someone to come and see me at the service counter where the neatly packaged card, original packaging and all, was checked in.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Then last thursday, that&#39;s two days ago now, I receive a call on my cell and a guy told me I can come pick up the card, so later that day I did. Once again i was faced with waiting quite a while before anybody came and they give me the packaged card and I sign the paper saying I got it. Something told me to look in the package and so I did. What do I find?\n</p>\n<p>\n  Not only was the card not fixed, it even contained the same few specks of dust at the same place they were before &#8211; and they ripped my lovely box a little. So I ask what the flying fuck is going on? Why the hell isn&#39;t my card fixed and how come it even looks completely untouched? The clerk gave me a compassionate response that he isn&#39;t one of the service people, that they work in the mornings and he can&#39;t tell me anything about anything. I should call or come next morning.\n</p>\n<p>\n  And so I did call next morning, well, at 2pm, but verily that&#39;s not very late afternoon even for a Friday, where I work we stay there until 6pm on Fridays, sometimes even later still. Needless to say I didn&#39;t quite manage to speak to any of the service people, as simple as nobody picking up the phone. I was told after the second redirect try that I&#39;d be redirected to the computer section rather than computer service section, but talking to those clerks doesn&#39;t really do me any good so I hung up before the call went through.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I have a suspicion that if I call right now, being Saturday, there won&#39;t be any service people there. So I&#39;m pinning my hopes on Monday to have this mess cleared up and told why the hell is my card still out of order.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Definitely never shoppping there again though &#8230; never again.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8e4e033b-aaf4-5e24-867a-6cd018f1c54e"}}
