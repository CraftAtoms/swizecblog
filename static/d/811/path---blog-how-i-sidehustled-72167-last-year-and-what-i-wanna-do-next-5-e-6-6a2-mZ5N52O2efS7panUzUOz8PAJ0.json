It started with an almost finished rewrite of <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js/\">React+D3v4</a> and a realization that I had <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/learned-6x-income-4-years/swizec/7340\">6x&#8217;d my income in 4 years</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>💥 Start with a bang 💪</h2>\n<div id=\"attachment_8014\" style=\"width: 1102px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8014\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/revenue-chart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1092\" height=\"792\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/revenue-chart.jpg 1092w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/revenue-chart-300x218.jpg 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/revenue-chart-768x557.jpg 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/revenue-chart-1024x743.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1092px) 100vw, 1092px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Month-by-month sidehustle revenue 2017</p></div>\n<p>Then I got busy with the sponsored <a href=\"http://reactnative.school\">Shoutem React Native school</a> project and everything else slowed down. Creating a new React Native app every other week is hard.</p>\n<p>So it took me 7 months of tweaking and updating <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js/\">React+D3v4</a> before it was ready. During this time, I also experimented with 1-on-1 coaching, tried <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/boutique-react-d3v4-workshop/swizec/7519\">selling React &amp; D3 workshops to consumers</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/SwizecTeller\">started vlogging</a>.</p>\n<p>Vlogging is fun, great for brand building. People comment about it a lot in real life, but they don&#8217;t press the magic Like button as much. ¯&#95;(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<p>Overall, the business was on life support. I flirted with the idea of giving up and living a normie life almost daily. It just seems so much easier.</p>\n<p>You go to work, you build what you&#8217;re told, you offload your stress, do overtime when the boss likes it, and collect your fat paycheck. Being a Silicon Valley startup employee is easy.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s not as fun.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s like my friend said, <em>&#8220;If you quit your sidehustle, you&#8217;re just gonna start a new one. Do you really think you can sit still and focus on One Thing?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>No.</p>\n<p>Business picked up again in September. <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js\">React+D3v4</a> launched to little excitement and tiny fanfare. Preorders were great, but there&#8217;s only so long you can keep people excited. When your product is 7 months late or more… heh 😅</p>\n<p>React+D3v4 did <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/9013-september-sidehustle-report-why-the-react-d3v4-launch/swizec/7837\">make $6.5k during launch</a>, so yay.

October made me crap my pants.</p>\n<p>A workshop deal from Real World React fell in my lap and I <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/teaching-stubhub-react-redux/swizec/7860\">taught the StubHub SF team about React and Redux</a>. I also turned 30 and ran <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/16661-october-sidehustle-report/swizec/7883\">a birthday promotion that made almost $6k in 1 day</a>.</p>\n<p>Life was good. I was flying high. Then November was bad, then December was good again. <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/teaching-backend-devs-react-redux-stubhub-boston/swizec/7952\">Another StubHub workshop</a>. This time in Boston.</p>\n<h2>Breakdown</h2>\n<p>For the curious, here&#8217;s how the year breaks down.</p>\n<p><strong>Total revenue: $72,167</strong></p>\n<p>Product sales: $37,240</p>\n<p>Packt royalties: $2,188</p>\n<p>Workshops: $19,684</p>\n<p>React Native School: $10,793</p>\n<p><strong>Time investment: 864 hours</strong></p>\n<p>An average of 16 hours per week, making a respectable but not great $83/h.</p>\n<p><strong>Total cost/investment: ~$43,000</strong></p>\n<p>Creating a measly post-cost pre-tax income of $33/hour.</p>\n<p>Better than minimum wage ($13/h) but talk to any engineer in Silicon Valley and they will tell you that number is just sad. I might as well give up now.</p>\n<p>But where&#8217;s the fun in that?</p>\n<h2>What I wanna do and build in 2018</h2>\n<p>Ultimately the goal for 2018 is to maintain this trajectory 👇</p>\n<figure><figcaption>\n<div id=\"attachment_8021\" style=\"width: 1078px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-8021 aligncenter\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-01.16.17.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2018-01-03 at 01.16.17\" width=\"1068\" height=\"812\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-01.16.17.png 1068w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-01.16.17-300x228.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-01.16.17-768x584.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-03-at-01.16.17-1024x779.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sidehustle growth trajectory</p></div>\n</figcaption></figure>\n<p>That means I gotta 2x my revenue. A cool $144,000. Preferably without 3x-ing the cost or worse.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because freedom, that&#8217;s why. Money is freedom.</p>\n<p>The more 💰 you have, the more you can do whatever you want. Something cool tickle your intellect? Wanna lock yourself in your room for 2 weeks and hack on something cool?</p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t do that if you got bills to pay and nothing to pay them with.</p>\n<p>And I really want to do that.</p>\n<p>So how am I going to get there? I don&#8217;t know yet to be honest. It&#8217;s daunting.</p>\n<p>Hitting $70k was largely a matter of luck. There was no systematic process. No step-by-step plan I followed to get there. I just did things and hoped for the best.</p>\n<figure>\n<div id=\"attachment_8010\" style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8010\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/strategic-plan.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/strategic-plan.jpg 500w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/strategic-plan-150x150.jpg 150w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/strategic-plan-300x300.jpg 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/strategic-plan-125x125.jpg 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">We have a plan</p></div>\n</figure>\n<h3>What I wanna build</h3>\n<p>My strategic plan is a lot like that. I&#8217;m going to Do Things and then Stuff Will Happen. I need to work on that plan, but here&#8217;s a list of some things plan to create 👇</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I wanna start <strong>a daily video series. Learn X while you poop</strong>. 2-min videos teaching React and Redux based on my StubHub workshop. Expand if that goes well.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’ve been thinking of a project for 2018. Something like “Learn X on your morning poop” where X is javascript or CS or code or somesuch.</p>\n<p>It would be a daily series of 2 or 3 min videos.</p>\n<p>Should I do it? 🤔</p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/946618544254541824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 29, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Not sure yet if this will be a paid product, a membership product, or a purely brand building marketing product. Perhaps all 3.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I’m going to <strong>update <a href=\"https://es2017.io\">es2017.io</a></strong> for 2018 and add any new stuff that&#8217;s coming to JavaScript. Keep that cheatsheet current.</li>\n<li>Create similar <strong>interactive cheatsheets for React, Redux, MobX, and D3</strong>. Separate cheatsheet for each. They&#8217;re great lead magnets for email subscribers.</li>\n<li>I want to build an <strong>open source Make Your Own Blockchain</strong> library based on Redux, Firebase, and some WebRTC. <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/blockchain-backed-redux-clone-105-lines-code/swizec/7980\">This is already in progress</a>. Not sure yet where I&#8217;m going with this, but it&#8217;s scratching my intellectual curiosity real good.If the blockchain works, I want to use it for a project/product/startup I had in mind. Not ready yet to tell you what it is just yet. 😇</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t give me too many products I can sell, now does it? Guess I&#8217;m just gonna have to write books/guides/courses about the stuff I learn along the way.</p>\n<p>It feels dangerous to set that as a sort of throwaway side goal, but I want to get better at iterating and launching products quickly. When I learn a cool new piece of tech, or figure something out, it shouldn&#8217;t take me 9 months to write a guide about it.</p>\n<h2>What needs to improve</h2>\n<p>And that&#8217;s what needs to improve. I have to get better at launching infoproducts quicker. I&#8217;m already good at writing every day. I can sit down and blurt out thousands of words on a topic.</p>\n<p>Those <a href=\"http://reactnative.school\">Shoutem React Native</a> articles, 4000+ words each? They took me 3 days to research and 2 days to write and video.</p>\n<p>If you put that in a book, it makes about 30 pages. I should definitely be able to launch more books and courses. Just gotta find the fire under butt. 🔥🍑</p>\n<p>Another very important part of the sidehustle that I need to improve is <a href=\"http://swizec.com\">http://swizec.com</a>. The homepage hasn&#8217;t been updated in 3 years and doesn&#8217;t even mention my sidehustle, which is ridiculous.</p>\n<p>My blog is also in dire need of an update. It doesn&#8217;t work well on mobile, syntax highlighting is all messed up, and it feels crufty and weird looking.</p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m gonna fix that. But I&#8217;m going to hire someone to help me.</p>\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;m fundamentally a web developer. Yes, I can do it on my own. And yet I haven&#8217;t found the time to do it in years. 😅</p>\n<p>Oh, and I have to work on my quote unquote Growth Engine. That&#8217;s the part of the business that brings in new people every day that you can talk to. I have some ideas 🤔</p>\n<h2>Fin</h2>\n<figure><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/POekkUcKs16gg/200.gif\" /></figure>\n<p>🤘</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ef85740c-96d6-580e-af7a-1b4397033f23"}}
