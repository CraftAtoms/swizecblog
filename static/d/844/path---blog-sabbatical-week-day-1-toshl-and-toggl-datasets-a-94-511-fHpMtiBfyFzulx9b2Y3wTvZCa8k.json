I just love collecting data that I never really look at &#8211; I think the only times when I actually went back to inspect my Toshl data were those <em>holy fuck, why am I suddenly out of money, where&#8217;d it all go!?</em>¬†moments.</p>\n<p>It was never the bank&#8217;s mistake üôÅ</p>\n<p><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Toggl.com\" href=\"http://www.toggl.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Toggl</a> is perhaps more widely known &#8211; possibly the simplest time tracker I have come across. Started using it in early June as a companion app to my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Klok\" href=\"http://klok.mcgraphix.com/klok/index.htm\" rel=\"homepage\">Klok</a> data for tracking productive productive time (the definition for Klok also includes things like exercise and chores for instance). In September or October I tightened up my use a bit further so Toggl only includes my billable time now.</p>\n<p>Combined Toshl and Toggl give me this awesome dataset to play with &#8211; a near daily report of my expected income and my actual expenses.</p>\n<p>The next step is obvious &#8211; I&#8217;m making a service for myself that, once a week:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>fetches toshl and toggl data</li>\n<li>runs a simple <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Machine learning\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\" rel=\"wikipedia\">machine learning algorithm</a></li>\n<li>sends me an email along the lines of <em>Hey dude, you&#8217;re gonna run out of money in two weeks. Just thought I&#8217;d mention that</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yesterday I made the fetching part in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Node.js\" href=\"http://nodejs.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">node.js</a> &#8211; a surprisingly difficult task when there&#8217;s no ready-made Toggl library and Toshl doesn&#8217;t even have an official API &#8211; and I&#8217;m tackling the learning bit today &#8230; perhaps even in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Haskell (programming language)\" href=\"http://haskell.org\" rel=\"homepage\">Haskell</a>. That should be interesting and couldn&#8217;t possibly fail right?</p>\n<p>Oh and if you ever find yourself in a situation where you have to reverse engineer an API from web forms make sure to send the <em>&#8216;Content-Type&#8217;: &#8216;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#8217;</em> header. Wasted at least an hour trying to figure out why my requests worked perfectly with Curl but not in Node.js.</p>\n<p>Of course it also helps if your target doesn&#8217;t have csrf protection; thanks for that Toshl team. You guys are awesome üôÇ</p>\n<p>PS: ping me if you think this sort of service could be useful to you too</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=604\">Review of expense tracker Toshl</a> (markos.gaivo.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.alwayssaving.com/money-saving-smartphone-apps/\">Money-saving smartphone apps</a> (alwayssaving.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/toggl-helps-discover-time/\">Toggl Helps You Discover Where Your Time Goes</a> (makeuseof.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://theworkathomewife.com/top-10-freelance-time-tracking-tools/\">Top 10 Freelance Time Tracking Tools</a> (theworkathomewife.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2011/12/10/time-keeping-apps/\">5 Timekeeping Apps for Your Small Business</a> (mashable.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8490093/node-js-share-sockets-between-processes\">node.js &#8211; share sockets between processes</a> (stackoverflow.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.intomobile.com/2011/11/04/mobile-expense-tracking-service-toshl-gets-brand-new-android-app/\">Mobile expense tracking service Toshl gets a brand new Android app</a> (intomobile.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=75f5e7d0-daac-4773-870d-c83333331ef0\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5020ff2a-b5f5-5744-a194-57b4ffb83311"}}
