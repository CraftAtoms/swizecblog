They&#8217;re awesome! Pay well, pay on time, easy to talk to, the work is interesting. Everything you&#8217;d want in a client.</p>\n<p>But three months ago their business changed and their need for a web generalist dwindled. Our relationship calmed down to just two days a week.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Great!&#8221;</em>, I thought, <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it easy for a while! Plenty of money in the bank, and I could use a break. Been working pretty hard the past few months&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Went back to Slovenia for two months. Took it easy. Spent a lot of time with friends. Spent even more time recovering from hangovers. Did a butt-tonne of sports.</p>\n<p>Life was grand.</p>\n<p>Did a few tiny writing gigs next to the two days a week of Real Work &#8482; because, hey, people asked and I had free time. But I wasn&#8217;t serious about looking for clients.</p>\n<p>The Client will surely need me for a more reasonable number of days in two months. We&#8217;ve loosely agreed to it! There was even a handshake! Wait &#8230; no, there was no handshake.</p>\n<p>A week before going back to on-site I was informed that our arrangement would continue at two days a week. There simply isn&#8217;t enough web development work to go around.</p>\n<p>Well, fuck.</p>\n<p>But hey, coffers are still pretty full. No biggie. I&#8217;ll just find other clients when I&#8217;m in the US. How hard can it be?</p>\n<p>And then April happened.</p>\n<p>Known to grown ups unlike myself as Taxes Month. Slovenia wanted just over €5000 for my sins of saving rather than spending money. Next to my regular monthly sacrifice to the Slovenian social system, of course.</p>\n<p>After paying rent and buying a plane ticket, my bank account only had some €4000 left.</p>\n<p>Fuck &#8230;</p>\n<p>The astute reader will notice this was almost €2000 short of what I would have to pay by mid-month. Essentially I&#8217;ve made 15k this year, and in April 10k went *poof*.</p>\n<p>Did I mention I hadn&#8217;t been grooming my work pipeline since early last year because I was really busy and very happy with my clients?</p>\n<p>How do people get new work again?</p>\n<p>Panic mode. I can delay paying the government by a few days or weeks because they&#8217;re a huge bureaucracy and won&#8217;t even notice, but my bank made me sign a few scary-looking blank checks in return for that credit card. Brown underpants time!</p>\n<p>Sent an email everyone I could find on HN&#8217;s monthly freelancer thread. Pinged every one in my network I could think of.</p>\n<p>Nothing.</p>\n<p>A week went by. I had a few calls with potential clients, nothing solid.</p>\n<p>Another week passed. An old client of mine remembered me. We quickly made a deal and I collected the customary 50% in advance. It&#8217;s now been 3 weeks and I finally got the full specs for the job. Will probably get the other 50% at the end of May, or later.</p>\n<p>Turns out that while Silicon Valley is absolutely brimming with opportunity and everyone is looking for programmers, actually getting work is insanely hard.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I wasn&#8217;t good enough. Or that I didn&#8217;t jibe with most of the potential clients.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s that everyone wants you to work full-time. Even when they&#8217;re okay with contracting, they want it to be full-time. Five days a week. What do you mean you only have three days of time?</p>\n<p>Suddenly that awesome client of mine that I really love working with turned into a huge liability. I imagine it&#8217;s a bit like dating with a huge wart over half of your face. An unnecessary handicap.</p>\n<p>Somebody even said <em>&#8220;We want to marry you. It doesn&#8217;t have to be right away, but eventually you have to be ours. Completely and utterly. Ours.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Yup.</p>\n<p>But on Friday everything coalesced. My standards had been beaten low enough. My will was broken. I would take pretty much anything I could get. I had three meetings with potential clients.</p>\n<p>Loved the first one, but their process looked long-ish and I was pressed for time. Signed an unfavourable deal with the second one. Third one told me it&#8217;s a shame I signed not an hour ago because they wanted to give me a better deal.</p>\n<p>Alas.</p>\n<p>But hey, I am back to being fully booked. It&#8217;s not ideal, it&#8217;s on a trial basis (my trial of them), but it extends my runway by a month and I can look for better clients in peace. No more worrying about pesky little things like staying alive and not having my kneecaps broken by goons.</p>\n<p>Naturally, The Client asked if I have more than two days of time this week &#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=afa3c729-d1c1-4677-bfe9-b9c686f02ef6\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"60505e82-df4e-57cf-af82-76e8d063b264"}}
