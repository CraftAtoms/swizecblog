At first I thought maybe I sprained it, but for the life of me couldn&#39;t figure out when or how and simply went on suffering. But one day last week at work it dawned on me, it wasn&#39;t a sprain at all, it was pain resulting from an inferior mouse I&#39;ve been using at work. It was a little next-to-laptop gizmo, meant for quick and infrequent use and because it was so damned small I was straining my thumb too much holding it.\n</p>\n<p>\nComplained about it to my boss and he said I could get a new one, just had to find a link. So I did and went on suffering &#8230; it even got so bad this weekend that I could barely lift a cup of tea without tears welling up in my eyes from the pain. Then Monday came and I was stuck with the stupid mouse, so what I did was try as much as I could not to hold it but only have my hand layed on it leisourly. It felt gay, but it worked, the pain ceased.\n</p>\n<p>\nBUT! Today I got a new mouse, a spanky MX1000 that is so far seeming very ergonomic and like it will mark the end of all my woes and silly compromises with mouse holding. I have work to do, I shouldn&#39;t have to keep thinking about how I hold my mouse so it doesn&#39;t kill me. So because I felt especially awesome with the new mouse, here&#39;s some comparison shots and what my desk looks like now.\n</p>\n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3087/2820734447_741c4e2cde.jpg?v=0\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" title=\"MX1000 package\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3057/2820734441_3a1e8909c5.jpg?v=0\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" title=\"Old mouse in front, new in back\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /><img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3223/2820734437_1af161c722.jpg?v=0\" border=\"0\" alt=\" \" title=\"New mousey\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" />\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b2177679-088d-5c6d-9adf-64f6858897f2"}}
