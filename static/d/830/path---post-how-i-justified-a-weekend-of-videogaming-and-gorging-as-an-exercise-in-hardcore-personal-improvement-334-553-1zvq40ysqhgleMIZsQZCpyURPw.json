Mostly <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/junk_food\" title=\"Junk food\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junk_food\">junk foods</a> like bits of smoked pigs and copious amounts of chocolate &#8230; very little eggs though, that&#8217;s a bit silly considering easter is supposed to be all about eggs.</p>\n<p>No matter, food was omnom.</p>\n<p>Now, how can a guy justify wasting so many hours on something as simple as <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/video_game\" title=\"Video game\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game\">videogames</a>? Well, I could say I was trying to have fun &#8230; but that&#8217;s a cop out, way too easy.</p>\n<p>The most importantest thing is the mechanics of my adventures. The game I was playing was <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/richard_burns_rally\" title=\"Richard Burns Rally\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burns_Rally\">Richard Burns Rally</a>, known far and wide as being one of the most, if not <em>the</em> most, difficult and realistic rally simulation games. The map I was playing was Mineshaft from Australia, in my humble opinion the hardest fucking map in the whole game.</p>\n<p>See in most of the maps you drive in some forrest or something and the worst that can happen is you ram a tree or lose time by going a bit wide and over some grass or something.</p>\n<p>But Mineshaft is different. Most of that damn thing is comprised of a road with a sheer drop cliff on one side and a cliff on the other. It&#8217;s a bit like trying to rally over the <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/yungas_road\" title=\"Yungas Road\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yungas_Road\">Yungas Road</a> (most dangerous road in the world FYI).</p>\n<p>So what the fuck are you rambling about Swizec. Just get on with the fucking point already sheesh!</p>\n<p>Alright alright. ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>My point is that ALL I did. For SEVERAL fucking hours. Was. Play. Richard Burns Rally. On. The. Hardest. Map.</p>\n<p>But why on god&#8217;s fucking earth would you do something like that?</p>\n<p>Well, because I could.</p>\n<p>But the important bit is why I wanted to. The game is insane to play on keyboards and needless to say I never once survived to the end of the map. Out of ~200 plays. I never once finished.</p>\n<p>Wtf, masochist?</p>\n<p>No. Through endless repetition and stupid iteration I learned. I learned a whole fucking lot! By the time I got fed up with playing I was habitually achieving mid times several seconds faster than the world record for that stage. Yes, the realistic world record.</p>\n<p>*gasp* *shocker*</p>\n<p>But I still didn&#8217;t finish, so the quest continues.</p>\n<p>My point is that this little experience teaches us a lot about life, the universe and everything. <span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\"><strong>Life is a series of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster</strong></span></p>\n<p>And that is all. Remember that. Whenever you are failing in life, you&#8217;re not failing, you&#8217;re <em>learning</em>. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. The more you fail the better a person you become, those times you dont&#8217; fail you haven&#8217;t learned a single thing. So stop that.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/ef748e69-9a88-46da-a6e5-f4d35edc270b/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=ef748e69-9a88-46da-a6e5-f4d35edc270b\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b180d405-3c82-52ae-8bce-fccddd5b3207"}}
