Global type inference that can figure out the general type of a whole program without a single type annotation anywhere.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve only ever used it in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Haskell (programming language)\" href=\"http://haskell.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Haskell</a> and let me tell ya, when I get confused, I delete my type annotations and let the compiler tell me what the hell I&#8217;m doing. It&#8217;s usually right.</p>\n<p>But while <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hindleyâ€“Milner\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Hindley-Milner</a> can do parametric polymorphism natively, it needed some work to support <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ad hoc polymorphism\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hoc_polymorphism\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">ad-hoc polymorphism</a> and become what Haskell&#8217;s got today. In their 1988 paper, <a href=\"http://202.3.77.10/users/karkare/courses/2010/cs653/Papers/ad-hoc-polymorphism.pdf\"><em>How to make ad-hoc polymorphism less ad hoc</em></a> Wadler and Blott of the Haskell committee explain how to do just that by introducing <em><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Type class\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">type classes</a></em>.</p>\n<p>Type classes are the biggest extension Haskell adds to Hindley-Milner, which makes it a more practical language than its predecessors Miranda and ML. But no more powerful, of course.</p>\n<h2 id=\"polymorphism\">Polymorphism</h2>\n<p>Polymorphism lets us define functions that can act on arguments of different types. Most obvious with operators where writing <code>1+4</code> works just as well as writing <code>1.3+3.14</code>, you don&#8217;t have to use <code>addInt</code> or <code>addFloat</code>. The compiler handles that for you.</p>\n<p>Strachey defined two types of polymorphism &#8211; <em>ad-hoc</em> and <em>parametric</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ad-hoc</strong> polymorphism occurs when a function behaves <em>differently</em> for different types, sometimes with completely heterogeneous implementations. Operator overloading is a common example of ad-hoc polymorphism</p>\n<p><strong>Parametric</strong> polymorphism occurs when a function behaves <em>the same</em> for different data types. <code>length</code> is a good example, because it doesn&#8217;t care what type of list it&#8217;s counting. You can implement a general <code>length</code> function to behave the same for any list type.</p>\n<p>This paper expands Hindley-Milner&#8217;s parametric polymorphism, with <em>type classes</em> to introduce ad-hoc polymorphism. Because the paper shows how to translate between type classes and pure HM, the authors claim any language using HM typing could potentially be retrofitted with type classes via a preprocessor.</p>\n<h2 id=\"limitations-of-ad-hoc-polymorphism\">Limitations of ad-hoc polymorphism</h2>\n<p>The easiest places to look at issues arising from ad-hoc polymorphism are arithmetic operator overloading and equality.</p>\n<p><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Standard ML\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Standard ML</a> takes the simplest approach to <strong>operator overloading</strong> &#8211; arithmetic operators are overloaded, but functions that use them are not. This means while you can write <code>3*3</code> or <code>3.14*3.14</code>, you cannot define a square function as <code>square x = x*x</code> and later use terms like <code>square 3</code> or <code>square 3.14</code>.</p>\n<p>You could solve this with an overloaded <code>square</code> function, using implementations of type <code>Int -> Int</code> and <code>Float -> Float</code>. This becomes unwieldy when you want to have a function <code>squares</code> that returns a tuple of three squared numbers. You&#8217;d need eight different implementations!</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Function overloading\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_overloading\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">overloaded functions</a> grow exponentially with the number of arguments. Not good.</p>\n<p><strong>Equality</strong> doesn&#8217;t fare much better. If you treat it as overloaded, like Standard ML used to, you can use terms such as <code>3*4 == 12</code>, but you <em>cannot</em> define functions based on equality. For instance, a function <code>member</code> that tells you whether something is in a list or not won&#8217;t have a defined type.</p>\n<p>Miranda takes a slightly better approach in that it treats equality as fully polymorphic. Its type is then <code>(==) :: a -> a -> Bool</code>, but this forces the environment to perform run-time checks on the <em>representation</em> of abstract types.</p>\n<p>Some might consider this a bug. Having to look inside an abstraction to decide its type definitely smells funny.</p>\n<p>More recent versions of Standard ML take the approach of making equality polymorphic in a limited fashion using something called <em>eqtype variables</em>. This means that type clashes are correctly returned as type errors, but still poses some limitations on the run-time implementation.</p>\n<p>Finally, <strong>object-oriented programming</strong> introduces the idea that users can define their own types. Getting these to support equality means having to force each object to carry with it a pointer to an <em>equality</em> function for that specific type. A dictionary of appropriate equality functions (to compare with different types) is even better.</p>\n<p>But a lot of those dictionaries will look exactly the same so we might as well pass them around separately from objects. This is the intuition behind type classes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"type-classes\">Type classes</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say we want to overload <code>(+)</code>, <code>(*)</code>, and <code>negate</code> on <code>Int</code> and <code>Float</code>. We can do this by introducing a <em>type class</em> called <code>Num</code> that says <em>&#8220;a type <code>a</code> belongs to <code>Num</code> if <code>(+)</code>, `(</em>)<code>, and</code>negate` in appropriate types are defined on it&#8221;*.</p>\n<p>Now we can define type instances such as <code>Num Int</code> and specify which functions to translate the overloaded symbols into. We assume things like <code>addInt</code> and <code>mulInt</code> are defined by default.</p>\n<pre>class Num a where\r\n  (+), (*) :: a -> a -> a\r\n  negate   :: a -> a\r\n\r\ninstance Num Int where\r\n  (+)    = addInt\r\n  (*)    = mulInt\r\n  negate = negInt\r\n\r\ninstance Num Float where\r\n  (+)    = addFloat\r\n  (*)    = mulFloat\r\n  negate = negFloat</pre>\n<p>This lets us define both the <code>square</code> and <code>squares</code> functions from before, but with a well-defined type at compile time.</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">square   :: Num a => a -> a\r\nsquare x = x*x\r\n\r\nsquares           :: Num a, Num b, Num c => (a,b,c) -> (a,b,c)\r\nsquares (x, y, z) = (square x, square y, square z)</pre>\n<p><code>square</code> is of type <code>a -> a</code> and the compiler will be able to resolve both <code>square 3</code> and <code>square 3.14</code> into their appropriate types. Similarly, <code>squares</code> no longer needs eight types, just one &#8211; <code>(a,b,c) -> (a,b,c)</code>.</p>\n<p>As expected, a call such as <code>square 'c'</code> will produce a type error because there is no <code>Char</code> instance of the <code>Num</code> type class.</p>\n<h2 id=\"translating-to-hindley-milner\">Translating to Hindley-Milner</h2>\n<p>A compiler can use our class and instance definitions to create dictionaries holding pointers to correct methods. For <code>Num</code> we introduce <code>NumD</code> as a type constructor for a new type whose values are created using <code>NumDict</code>. Functions <code>add</code>, <code>mul</code>, and <code>neg</code> take a value of type <code>NumD</code> and return its first, second, or third component.</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">data NumD a = NumDict (a -> a -> a) (a -> a -> a) (a -> a)\r\n\r\nadd (NumDict a m n) = a\r\nmul (NumDict a m n) = m\r\nneg (NumDict a m n) = n\r\n\r\nnumDInt :: NumD Int\r\nnumDInt =  NumDict addInt muLInt negInt\r\n\r\nnumDFLoat :: NumD Float\r\nnumDFloat =  NumDict addFloat mulFloat negFloat</pre>\n<p>To use <code>NumD</code> a compiler would simply replace all instances of <code>Num</code> with their respective dictionary values, as identified by the type. For instance, <code>x+y</code> translates into <code>add numD x y</code>.</p>\n<p><code>add numD</code> returns the correct <code>addInt</code> or <code>addFloat</code> function as identified by the type of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, then applies said function on the arguments. It&#8217;s pretty nifty.</p>\n<p>Our <code>square</code> example becomes <code>square'</code>:</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">square'        :: NumD a -> a -> a\r\nsquare' numD x =  mul numD x x</pre>\n<p>Which means that a call such as <code>square 3</code> will translate into <code>square' numDInt 3</code> and <code>square 3.2</code> into <code>square' numDFloat 3</code>.</p>\n<p>A similar conversion works for <code>squares</code>, just with more characters involved.</p>\n<h2 id=\"type-classes-and-equality\">Type classes and equality</h2>\n<p>When applied to equality, type classes don&#8217;t differ much from Standard ML&#8217;s eqtype variables. But they allow the compiler to decide types at compile-time rather than run-time and a user can easily extend new classes to support abstract types.</p>\n<p>The definition is similar to how we defined <code>Num</code> earlier &#8211; we&#8217;ll make a type class called <code>Eq</code> and define instances for <code>Int</code> and <code>Char</code>. We&#8217;ll also define a <code>member</code> function, which was giving us trouble earlier.</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">class  Eq a where\r\n  (==) :: a -> a -> bool\r\n\r\ninstance Eq Int where\r\n  (==) = eqInt\r\n\r\ninstance Eq Char where\r\n  (==) = eqChar\r\n\r\nmember          :: Eq a => [a] -> a -> Bool\r\nmember [] y     =  False\r\nmember (x:xs) y =  (x == y) \\/ member xs y</pre>\n<p>As you can imagine we can now write terms such as <code>5 == 4</code>, <code>'a' == 'b'</code>, and <code>member \"Haskell\" 'k'</code> or <code>member [1,2,3] 2</code>. The compiler can infer the correct type each time and using <code>member</code> on a type that doesn&#8217;t have an <code>Eq</code> instance will produce a type error.</p>\n<p>But what&#8217;s really cool is that we can define equality between lists and tuples. Even crazier things &#8211; sets, random data types we define ourselves, anything really.</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">instance Eq a, Eq b => Eq (a,b) where\r\n (u,v) == (x,y)     = (u == x) &amp; (v == y)\r\n\r\ninstance Eq a => Eq [a] where\r\n  [] == []         = True\r\n  [] == y:ys       = False\r\n x:xs == []        = False\r\n x:xs == y:ys      = (x == y) &amp; (xs == ys)</pre>\n<p>Essentially <em>&#8220;two tuples are equal if their members are equal&#8221;</em> and <em>&#8220;lists are equal if they are both empty, or their heads and tails are equal&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Now we can write terms such as <code>\"Haskell\" == \"Curry\"</code> and even <code>member [\"Haskell\", \"Alonzo\"] \"Moses\"</code>.</p>\n<p>The compiler figures this out in much the same way as before &#8211; using dictionaries. I&#8217;m not going to type it all out but, for instance, integers will have a corresponding <code>eqDInt</code> function, characters will have an <code>eqDChar</code> function and so on.</p>\n<p>A term such as <code>3*4 == 12</code> will translate into <code>eq eqDInt (mul numDInt 3 4) 12</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"subclasses\">Subclasses</h2>\n<p>So far we&#8217;ve treated <code>Num</code> and <code>Eq</code> as completely different classes. But it makes sense that all numerical types should also be comparable, while all comparable types might not be numerical.</p>\n<p>We can make <code>Num</code> a subclass of <code>Eq</code>:</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">class Eq a => Num a where\r\n  (+)    :: a -> a -> a\r\n  (*)    :: a -> a -> a\r\n  negate :: a -> a</pre>\n<p>This asserts that <code>a</code> may belong to class <code>Num</code> only if it also belongs to <code>Eq</code>, making <code>Num</code> a subclass of <code>Eq</code>. All other class and instance declarations remain the same. Things magically just work.</p>\n<p>Now we can write functions like this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"haskell\">memsq :: Num a => [a] -> a -> Bool\r\nmemsq xs x = member xs (square x)</pre>\n<p>Because <code>Eq</code> is implied by <code>Num</code>, we didn&#8217;t have to mention it in the type. Neat.</p>\n<p>A nice consequence of dictionary-based translation is also that we can define as many super- and subclasses as we want and it doesn&#8217;t confuse the compiler in the least. This is a great advantage from object-oriented languages where having many superclasses usually poses implementation problems.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Now you know how type classes work in Haskell. They introduce a lot of neat things that help us write more expressive code while, naturally, not increasing the power of the language.</p>\n<p>The only issue with type classes is that they introduce extra parameters to be passed around at run-time (the dictionaries), but that&#8217;s not too bad.</p>\n<p>The rest of the paper deals with formalising this intuitive definition of type classes using lambda calculus. But I&#8217;m not going to include that in my summary, it&#8217;s too mathsy and doesn&#8217;t add much to understanding what&#8217;s going on. At least it didn&#8217;t for me.</p>\n<p>That said, I finally understand how Haskell&#8217;s type system works. Now if only I could find more excuses to actually <em>use</em> Haskell.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=39dd8c31-06b9-4031-8054-29577e252e96\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"49fae3b2-6160-5029-a3bc-536f5012cfe8"}}
