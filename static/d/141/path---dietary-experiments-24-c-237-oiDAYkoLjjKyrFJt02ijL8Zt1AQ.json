{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Dietary experiments","content":"<p>A few months ago I&#8217;ve spoken about student food going up in price and that I will most probably stop eating student food as a result. I would even find that particular post to link if I had more time to develop this blog and included a search, but alas, no luck.</p>\n<p>So anyhow, after the leftover student certificates held up for a month and then the exam season started when I was at home all day long and thus had the time and energy to cook real food, I have this weekend finally come to a point where it&#8217;s time to start depending upon myself for food again. However, I still don&#8217;t want to buy student certificates because I still think spending that much money on a single meal is rather excessive.</p>\n<p>But without eating food from the fridge and without going out to eat, what other option am I left with? It just so turns out I have a bunch of protein and protein bars lying around because I usually have a protein shake after working out and used to have half a protein bar for lunch a while back until I got bored with it and was left with a bunch of unused bars.</p>\n<p>The solution was simple, replace the one regular meal per day with a protein meal. So for some time I will now be eating one protein bar and one protein shake a day, which is supposedly somewhat unhealthy and rather unwise. I&#8217;m not sure, that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s called an experiment.</p>\n<p>The potentially biggest problem I&#8217;m facing with this whole thing is that the previously described dietary intake plus some tea and perhaps fruit/vegetable for vitamins amounts to only about 700 calories a day, which isn&#8217;t very much far as I know (recommended is 1500 a day). And somewhat quite interestingly after being on this diet for only two days I&#8217;ve noticed that I get a lot more tired at the gym and need much larger breaks. I also seem to think a little bit slower, but that could be the side-effect of very little caffeine input today.</p>\n<p>Hopefully this new diet of mine will make me lose some fat off my body while being enough substance to at least sustain muscle mass &#8230; and hopefully I won&#8217;t, you know, faint or anything.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2347739f-f4fa-5d13-8eac-4a0059e4ff82"}}
