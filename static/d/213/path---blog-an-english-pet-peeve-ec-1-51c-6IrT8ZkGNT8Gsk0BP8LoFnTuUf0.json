Where I say it&#8217;s better to stand up when editing?</p>\n<p>It works! Only problem is I get kicked out of the kitchen around 4pm, just about an hour after I really properly get to work.</p>\n<p>Today I want to talk about a little pet peeve I&#8217;ve developed with English over the past few days.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Sometimes I feel English majors are the only people who would understand me, but I don‚Äôt know any üôÅ</p>\n<p>‚Äî Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/332973149178187776\">May 10, 2013</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Since my d3.js book is supposed to be very inclusive and inviting I use the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Grammatical person\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_person\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">first person plural</a> a lot. It just sounds better when going through examples to say &#8220;Here we do X&#8221; instead of a preachy &#8220;You should do X&#8221; or a self-absorbed &#8220;I did X&#8221; &#8230; you know, like this post.</p>\n<p>As such there are a lot of instances where I write &#8220;Let&#8217;s do something or another&#8221;. <em>Let&#8217;s</em> being a contraction of <em>let us</em>.</p>\n<p>Now <em>let</em> is a funny little verb in the English language. It&#8217;s got no fewer than eight meanings, adding some <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Verb phrase\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verb_phrase\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">verb phrases</a> and idioms the number goes all the way up to <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/let?r=75&amp;src=ref&amp;ch=dic\" target=\"_blank\"><em>nine-teen</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Talk about overloading operators, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Scala (programming language)\" href=\"http://www.scala-lang.org/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Scala</a> can hide in shame before the might of English.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s &#8211; see how I sneakily used the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Possessive\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possessive\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">possessive form</a> and not a contraction of let us &#8211; primary meaning is roughly &#8220;to allow&#8221;, so when you say &#8220;Let&#8217;s go!&#8221; you are pretty much saying &#8220;Allow us to go!&#8221;. But with slightly less imperative in your voice.</p>\n<p>All fine and good.</p>\n<p>But in the book I also talk about third parties a lot. It&#8217;s not just me and the reader that are having fun, behind the scenes d3.js&#8217;s functions are working hard to keep us happy. I often write &#8220;This or that function lets us do this or that&#8221;</p>\n<p><em>lets us</em></p>\n<p>Using &#8220;lets us&#8221; feels more appropriate than saying &#8220;allows us to&#8221; or even &#8220;enables us to&#8221;, especially when I&#8217;m supposed to be shortening my manuscript by 60 pages before publication. And it just feels snappier and better paced than the alternatives.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the dilemma: &#8220;lets us&#8221; works in some cases, &#8220;let&#8217;s&#8221; in others and &#8220;let&#8217;s us&#8221; is far out. Laughably wrong.</p>\n<p>And one of those appears almost in every other paragraph. Paragraph after paragraph, page after page, for 180 pages.</p>\n<p>Every single time I see those six letters I have to stop, take a deep breath, and make sure they are correct. Every. Single. Time.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=864e6d38-e99f-4db9-99ac-c63f63b65ab8\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8382bdbd-e5e6-50d6-a338-a06c38107d68"}}
