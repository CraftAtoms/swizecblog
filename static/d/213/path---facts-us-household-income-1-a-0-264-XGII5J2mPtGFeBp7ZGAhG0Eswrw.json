I want to compare it to the software engineer salary dataset I already have.</p>\n<p>While that&#8217;s brewing, here are some facts I found, complete with sources and in no particular order. Not all facts agree with each other, and I don&#8217;t know why. ?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">25.2% of the United States&#39;s population lives in a upper middle class household; with an annual income between $75,000 and $150,000.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/781396400680505344\">September 29, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cost-of-living.careertrends.com/l/615/The-United-States\">[CareerTrends.com]</a></p>\n<p>The median household income tells you what is considered “middle class” in a certain area. 67% of median to 200% of median falls into middle class. You can use this as a rough proxy for cost of living in an area.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/how-the-median-income-compares-to-cost-of-living-in-129-1727448351\">[LifeHacker]</a></p>\n<p>&#8220;Cost of living&#8221; is not a defined thing. Most researchers build a composite index based on tens, sometimes hundreds, of indicators that feel right. Things like cost of groceries, rent, transportation, and stuff like that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this data set, the Composite Index is a measurement of the relative price of goods and services within an area. These prices include things like rent, healthcare, groceries, transportation, and more. Collectively, they are considered the &#8220;cost of living.&#8221;</p>\n<p>All percentages are comparisons to the national average. The national average is represented by &#8220;100%,&#8221; so a city that has a 132% composite index is a city where goods and services (or the cost of living) are about 32% more than the national average.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.edq.com/data-quality-infographics/cost-of-living-in-america/\">[Experian Data Quality]</a></p>\n<p>In 2005, a household income over $250,000 put you in the top 1.5%. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affluence_in_the_United_States\">[1]</a> By 2014, that same income put you in the top 3%. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Distribution_of_household_income\">[2]</a> This implies the top of the pile really is retaining more than it used.</p>\n<p>Median household income does not follow a uniform random distribution. This implies network effects play a large role in how much you can earn.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/US_county_household_median_income_2012.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>Social class in the US has an interesting definition:</p>\n<p>While many people in the US believe in a three-class system, sociologists disagree on their precise definition and acknowledge that class structure (particularly in the the “middle class&#8221;) does not always match income distribution.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Social_class\">[3]</a></p>\n<p>Why so much focus on those oh so very evil people at the top? The ones we hate vicariously through episodes of Mr. Robot?</p>\n<p>Because the average software engineer makes $90,000/year, according to my dataset.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/96c3fBf.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>If you&#8217;re an average software engineer in the United States, and you have a salaried job, <em>you are an upper middle class <strong>household</strong></em>. You, personally, as an individual.</p>\n<p>?</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;m making yet, but it smells like there&#8217;s a good story in here somewhere.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6bb2b552-9734-5aec-9c1f-a0a7d56378da"}}
