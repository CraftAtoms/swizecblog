Leaving aside for a moment considerations that this might have been an epic case of sarcasm &#8230; writing a post every day isn&#8217;t that difficult anyway.</p>\n<p>When you think about it, everyone probably writes a blogpost&#8217;s worth of words every day.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Many people tweet about 20 times a day &#8211; that&#8217;s roughly 140 words right there. Enough for a daily tumblr blogpost thing</li>\n<li>Those using facebook probably write about  5 status updates a day &#8211; 50 words right there?</li>\n<li>And you probably write email as well. This gives you at least 300 words a day.</li>\n<li>Hang out on skype or IRC? Doubtlessly at least 200 words a day right there as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Considering those numbers, it&#8217;s safe to say the average internet citizen writes 500 to 1000 or even 1500 words <em>every single day</em>. In my experience the sweet spot for blogs is ~600 words.</p>\n<p>This means that each and every one of you writes a blog post or two every day. Why aren&#8217;t you publishing this anywhere?</p>\n<p>Statistics aside, writing is mostly about practice. I would love nothing more than claim writing is an inherent talent and make myself feel super special &#8211; but I can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s just practice, practice and when you think you&#8217;re just about done, some more practice.</p>\n<p>The part that isn&#8217;t practice is the discipline to plomp your arse down and <em>write</em> be it rain or snow, sunshine or a cat begging to be fed. Staring at a blank page is always a little daunting, but once you actually get going your mind will usually take care of the rest and keep you going.</p>\n<p>It helps if you can type too &#8230; knowledge of at least one human language doesn&#8217;t hurt either.</p>\n<p>Doing the daily <a title=\"750 words a day keeps the insanity away\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/750-words-a-day-keeps-the-insanity-away/swizec/1703\" target=\"_blank\">750 words</a> has helped me immensely with the part of plomping my arse down and writing. My problem has always been that I&#8217;m sort of good with keeping a train of thought going &#8211; much to the surprise of anyone who&#8217;s ever talked to me in person &#8211; and delivering in a digestible sometimes even entertaining form. I&#8217;m lucky that my writing rarely makes people vomit.</p>\n<p>After 750words gave me an incentive to write roughly three pages of text every day, and assured me that it really really doesn&#8217;t matter what I write &#8211; silencing my inner critic so to say &#8211; everything got much simpler. Combined with the daily blogpost my baseline for writing every day is probably around 1400 words every single day. And that&#8217;s before all the twitter and email!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3063\" style=\"width: 663px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.06-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3063 \" title=\"Writing incentives!\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.06-PM.png\" alt=\"Writing incentives!\" width=\"653\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.06-PM.png 816w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.06-PM-300x134.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Writing incentives!</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_3064\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.18-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3064 \" title=\"Quite a bit of words\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.18-PM.png\" alt=\"Quite a bit of words\" width=\"650\" height=\"127\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.18-PM.png 812w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-24-at-2.27.18-PM-300x58.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Quite a bit of words</p></div>\n<p>Actually, now that I think about it &#8230; why am I writing so much and not working on the next big novel, like I&#8217;ve wanted to since I was 10? There&#8217;s a whole competition going on right now (<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"NaNoWriMo\" href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org\" rel=\"homepage\">NaNoWriMo</a>) about getting people to write 1666 words every day to produce a novel in a month. Looks like I&#8217;m producing a novel-length wall of text every month and a half &#8230;</p>\n<p>But anyway, if you want to start writing something every day, and I heartily suggest that you do, there are two easy steps to take: <em>write</em> and <em>write</em>. It&#8217;s that simple.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If you want also to show anyone what you&#8217;ve written, I suggest giving <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439156816/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ageewitahat-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1439156816\" target=\"_blank\">On Writing, by Stephen King</a> a read.
