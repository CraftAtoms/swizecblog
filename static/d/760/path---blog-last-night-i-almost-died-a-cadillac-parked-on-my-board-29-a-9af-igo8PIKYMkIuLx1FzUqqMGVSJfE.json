A Cadillac &#8220;parked&#8221; on my board","content":"<p>Last night I almost died.</p>\n<p>Three months ago I splurged $1600 on a Boosted Board to get around town. Coming to San Francisco and crashing in a sublet room in the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dogpatch\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogpatch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Dogpatch</a>, my Uber costs were through the roof.</p>\n<p>$10 to get there and $10 to get back every time I went out. Going to the movies? $20 roundtrip. Going to a nice restaurant? $20 roundtrip. Going to the office in SoMa? $30 roundtrip because surge pricing.</p>\n<p>Fuck surge pricing.</p>\n<p>Things exploded once I started going to the office every day. A potential $150 <em>per week</em> just for Uber. Sure, I could use public transit, take the T down to AT&amp;T park, then walk for ten minutes to the office and ugh &#8230; no.</p>\n<p>Moving to SoMa helped, but the boxing gym I go to four times a week is still in the Dogpatch. $20 roundtrip. $80 per week. Ugh &#8230; no.</p>\n<p>What I needed was an electric longboard just like those in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Xkcd\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xkcd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">XKCD</a>. A Boosted Board.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/electric_skateboard_double_comic.png\" alt=\"XKCD electric skateboard\" /><figcaption>XKCD electric skateboard</figcaption></figure>\n<p>At a top speed of 22mph and a width of not very much, that thing slashes right through San Francisco&#8217;s traffic. What Giants game? What traffic jam? Boosted Board don&#8217;t care.</p>\n<p>You can pass a traffic jam two blocks long in the span of one stop light. It&#8217;s phenomenal! And it&#8217;s going to stay phenomenal until someone doors me. That will suck.</p>\n<p>Remember the mantra, ride like you are invisible.</p>\n<p>Once you get on an open road, that&#8217;s when things get really crazy. Wind in your helmet, tears streaming down your face from the wind, right thumb smashing the controls to full throttle.</p>\n<p>It <em>feels</em> slow because it&#8217;s limited and stops accelerating, but when you look down. Ho boy. The road is a blur and all you can think of is that a few months ago you would have killed for a hill steep and long enough to ride a longboard this fast and with this much control.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;re flying.</p>\n<p>And yes, an Uber is faster on an open road. But an Uber also costs money and a Boosted is a one-time sunk cost. The more you use it, the cheaper it gets! Hell, mine is already almost free.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NCCUdM4.png\" alt=\"Boosted vs. Uber graph\" /><figcaption>Boosted vs. Uber graph</figcaption></figure>\n<p>I knew it was going to be worth it when I bought the thing, but I still didn&#8217;t expect such a sharp drop. Just look at that graph! Almost 400 euro in May, down to just 70 in June. Even down to 30 in August.</p>\n<p>These days I only pay for Uber because you can&#8217;t Boosted to a date night.</p>\n<p>A Boosted Board is fun, is cheap, is awesome, is the best purchase I ever made. Right after my hat.</p>\n<p>But last night I almost died.</p>\n<p>Zooming down the bicycle lane on 4th street right after dusk. Wearing all black, going balls out fast, I was pretty much invisible.</p>\n<p>A giant <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Cadillac SRX\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadillac_SRX\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Cadillac SRX</a> cut me off when it turned left on a green light. We didn&#8217;t collide. I went from full throttle to full reverse in a fraction of a second and lost all traction on my back wheels.</p>\n<p>My board went into a slide, gripped the asphalt, and kicked me off. Just like every time I start learning how to stand-up slide on a classic longboard.</p>\n<p>I flew off, learned that I can&#8217;t run at 22mph, and smashed into the ground. Sliding glove on my left hand stopped that palm from getting shredded, and some quick thinking saved my right hand. A roll saved the palm, but the top of my hand has some nasty looking scratches.</p>\n<p>Can&#8217;t wear gloves on the right hand, need fine thumb control for the throttle. Bummer.</p>\n<p>At least the board is safe. That damn Cadillac parked right on top of it. Right on top. He even had to back up so I could dislodge the longboard from underneath his front wheel. Yup.</p>\n<p>The guy didn&#8217;t even get out of his car when he saw me flying. Just rolled down his window and asked if I was okay. Shouting. Riled up. He seemed like he&#8217;d almost had a heart attack.</p>\n<p>Or maybe he just didn&#8217;t like that there was this bloke getting off the floor, shaking his head in disbelief, and saying <em>&#8220;What the fuck man? Did you not see me?&#8221;</em> in an angry tone.</p>\n<p>Whatever it was, I&#8217;m glad my lack of sports gave me all that practice falling off longboards. And that a Boosted Board can survive having a Cadillac SRX parked on top.</p>\n<p>Now excuse me while I go invest some of those Uber savings in a helmet light.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"50727a18-5930-58a1-b393-1f29568583cf"}}
