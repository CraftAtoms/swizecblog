It worked out fucking perfectly, got confused for a female at least five times and I&#8217;m told I looked downright 16 &#8230; why I got liquor so easily though might be evidence against such claims. Unfortunately this is the only image I&#8217;ve got, I also had an emo backpack, emo fingernail job and some other tidbits that made me bloody awesome!</p>\n<p>Halloween being the last day of October brings us to another topic &#8211; <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"NaNoWriMo\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/\">NaNoWriMo</a>.</p>\n<p>NaNoWriMo is an annual event that started nigh on ten years ago in the US and soon spread over the globe. The goal is to write a [short] novel of 50k words in a single month. You&#8217;re supposed to write write write without fussing too much over perfection and details, those are for some other time. My first attempt was way back in 2005 when I actually managed to win by producing some utter garbage. Right the next year I failed.</p>\n<p>For some reason or another, insanity being most likely, I&#8217;ve decided to write a novel this month. Of course I&#8217;m not going to win because I simply don&#8217;t have enough time and midterms will be starting in a few weeks. Yay. I also have no idea what I&#8217;m going to write about, but I&#8217;ve settled on doing something Steampunk in a Gonzo style (due to time restrictions) and the basic premise being Vampires, because @<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"tamejhna\" rel=\"twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/tamejhna\">tamejhna</a> said so. We&#8217;ll see what happens, but hopefully I&#8217;ll produce a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Novella\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novella\">novella</a> of about 25k words, worthy of being published in Steampunk Magazine &#8230; been a while since I published anything there.</p>\n<p>This month being November brings us to yet another bit of madness. Beardvember!</p>\n<p>The first I learned of beardvember was through <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Paul Southworth\" rel=\"twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/Southworth\">Paul Southworth</a> (@southworth) and his rants underneath the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ugly Hill\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.uglyhill.com/\">Ugly Hill</a> comic, it&#8217;s still a bloody shame he stopped drawing that). The idea here is that you leave your face to run wild with hair for a month and see what happens. If you&#8217;re silly enough you also take a photo every day and then make a gif from it, which I&#8217;ll attempt.</p>\n<p>So, uhm, yes &#8230; THIS. IS. MADNESS!
