It just wouldn&#39;t work and doing a lot of graphic artistry I can&#39;t be having that, it&#39;s a vital tool. Another is the almost impossibility of setting up a proper firewall, for some reason Kubuntu just did not start up iptables on every reboot. Crazy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therefore I&#39;m commencing the move back to Gentoo today, should&#39;ve started it yesterday, but somehow did not. The sad fact is that it will take about three days, but at least the computer will be of no use and I&#39;ll be able to do more studying.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"558a186c-5a35-5b5a-ad44-aaa996b101ed"}}
