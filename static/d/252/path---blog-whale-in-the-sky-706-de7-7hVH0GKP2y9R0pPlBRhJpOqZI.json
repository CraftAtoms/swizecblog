{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Whale in the sky","content":"<p>\nA few days ago<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airbus_A380\" target=\"_blank\"> the new whale of the skies</a> has apparently been taken for a test drive with some press people and businessmen in its bowels. They created a nice <a href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/science_news/4213543.html\">news post</a> about it accompanied by a rather impressive video of what went on.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe biggest concern surrounding the Airbus A380 right now seems to be its sheer size and massivenes, which is apparently the reason for why it hasn&#39;t realyl been bought by almost anyone. It is said that terminals would have to be modified a lot and runways made stronger and that it simply does not fit today&#39;s world and is rather too large. Hold on, too large to be useful? Isn&#39;t that the same thing that was said of the Boeing 747 all those years ago, think it was 40, and isn&#39;t that right now the single most commercially succesful whale of the skies? Just give the poor sappling some time people, it&#39;ll catch on, you&#39;ll see.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"558a9974-d3b7-5c8b-bfcf-f6c27c4a7575"}}
