{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Still an idiot, but with a sexy desktopo now","content":"<p>\nSo as it turns out I&#39;m such an idiot as to forget to mention why exactly I was an idiot in the first place when <a href=\"http://swizec.com/index.php/mode=news/id=339\">previously talking about idiocy</a> . What I was going to mention was why exactly it is that Lestat took so long to get fixed up and why he wasn&#39;t working in the first place. As it turns out processors have separate power connectors these days and I quite simply didn&#39;t connect it and thus &#8230; problems.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut let&#39;s put all of that aside for now, I&#39;m here to talk about how sexy linux has become, well it&#39;s been sexy before but I&#39;ve never quite tapped into the vast expense of sexiness available to me for one reason or another. Of course I&#39;ve mentioned some of this before, but this time there&#39;s a video and with window decorations all fixed up and sexy as well.\n</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,29,0\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/dYVAItjo4Bo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;fmt=18\" /><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\" /><param name=\"menu\" value=\"false\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"\" /><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/dYVAItjo4Bo&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1&amp;fmt=18\" wmode=\"\" quality=\"high\" menu=\"false\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>\nYou might notice that there&#39;s still a bunch of other plugins I could have enabled, shown even, but I didn&#39;t because I either don&#39;t know about them or was, for the time being, too dazzled by all of this as it was to think of even more sexy things to find.\n</p>\n<p>\nSomewhere at around 2:32 in the video you might notice me adding a cup of tea on the desktop. That&#39;s my <a href=\"http://kde-look.org/content/show.php/Tea+Cooker?content=85564\" target=\"_blank\">Tea Cooker plasmoid</a>  I was talking about making. So far it&#39;s had a night&#39;s worth of development put in and me basically learning everything I did along the way &#8230; SVG graphics, by the by, are bloody awesome things. It&#39;s not very useful yet but it&#39;s had 23 downloads in what is essentially a single day. That&#39;s surprisingly plenty for something that doesn&#39;t even half work yet (can&#39;t quite stop/start/reset the timer yet) and I <em>do</em> intend on making it a lot better, but am having some trouble with libraries and such so I&#39;m waiting for the final release of kde4.1 in hopes it solves my problems.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"18b8f2cd-d5c9-5368-97d6-8aa3e62416ac"}}
