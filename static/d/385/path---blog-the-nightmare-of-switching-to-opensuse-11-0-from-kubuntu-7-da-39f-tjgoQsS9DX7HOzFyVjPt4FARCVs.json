And yesterday I did, I downloaded openSUSE and installed it.</p>\n<p>The installation process seemed to go smoothly enough, a checkbox here, an input field there, a complaint about fstab here and there, a few suggested fixes and away we go. Reboot.</p>\n<p>But after the reboot I was in for an unfriendly surprise &#8211; it couldn&#8217;t properly read the fstab it had created. Err what? Then it couldn&#8217;t mount some partitions and wanted me to fix things &#8230; errr sure, fine, at least I know what a fstab is and aren&#8217;t just some poor home-user.</p>\n<p>Mmkay, so the fixing tool couldn&#8217;t quite read the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Disk partitioning\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_partitioning\">partition table</a> either and wanted to make some stuff up. No fucking way mister, I need my datas. But it still somehow managed to kill 300 gigs of movies and tv shows üôÅ That sucked a whole lot.</p>\n<p>And still it didn&#8217;t work.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"display: block; width: 250px; margin: 1em; float: left;\">\n<div>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12345574@N00/38761786\"><img title=\"fstab\" src=\"http://farm1.static.flickr.com/33/38761786_55259fe242_m.jpg\" alt=\"fstab\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd zemanta-img-attribution\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/12345574@N00/38761786\">markuz</a> via Flickr</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Alright, we&#8217;ll do a reinstall. Err, hi dear computer user, I can&#8217;t read this fstab I&#8217;ve made, help me out please. Sure, I&#8217;ll help you out you fucking moron of openSUSE. How come you can magically read it when I say &#8220;use the old table&#8221;?</p>\n<p>Then it didn&#8217;t install, guess why, oh that&#8217;s right, the fixing tool made one of the partitions with -5.00MB of free space. Wtf!? So the installer complained, wait for it, there isn&#8217;t enough disk space to install openSUSE. HA! Fine, we won&#8217;t mount that partition, magically it almost worked. I ended up having to forcfully not mount all of my data partitions so that it could finally mount everything it wanted and just do a fucking install.</p>\n<p>So I finally get into KDE and it&#8217;s all fugly and crap. But alright, that&#8217;s to be expected, needs drivers after all. What&#8217;s this? No internets? Fine.</p>\n<p>After spending half an hour doing what should only take a couple of minutes I could finally get online, I still don&#8217;t know which setting exactly managed to finally do it. And hey, even routing (I use the computer for a router too) magically worked. Lovely.</p>\n<p>Finally I managed to install the nvidia drivers (no, not from the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Installation (computer programs)\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_%28computer_programs%29\">software installation</a> tool like I would in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ubuntu\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu\">Ubuntu</a>, I had to find them on my own, windows much?). It then took me a good twenty minutes to find the right screen resolution, if I&#8217;m not mistaken Ubuntu manages this on its own. Then I couldn&#8217;t get dual monitors to work through the settings tool and had to use nvidia&#8217;s proprietary thingy. Sure, I have to use nvidia-settings in Ubuntu as well, but for fuck&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t present me with a configuration option that doesn&#8217;t work!</p>\n<p>Now I wanted lovely <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Compiz Fusion\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiz_Fusion\">Compiz Fusion</a> effects, because I simply feel that having a beefy graphics card and a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Linux\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\">Linux</a> should mean a sexy user experience (unlike Windows who can&#8217;t provide one). Alright, we just go to the software managment tool and install compiz.</p>\n<p>Accidentally I clicked a package I wanted (think it was compiz-plugins-extra) and I get an ugly popup box crying out loud that this cannot be done, that there are dependencies that cannot be fulfilled &#8230; three rows down I clicked compiz-plugins-main and lo and behold, dependancy resolved. The correct order of clicking checkboxes isn&#8217;t something I should be troubled with in 2009.</p>\n<p>After installing compiz there was no way to configure it because the config thingy is in a different package and I&#8217;d forgotten about that. So I go install that but what&#8217;s this. CAN&#8217;T, because I need a newer compiz (yes, it was an ugly we can&#8217;t solve this dependancy popup), ok fine for fuck&#8217;s sake, just install the newer compiz. I don&#8217;t fucking give a fuck about this, it&#8217;s 2009 for fuck&#8217;s sake!</p>\n<p>But, you&#8217;ve guessed it, I was presented with a fucking huge popup box with hundreds of checkboxes that, I believe, would drive me into dependancy hell while updating the whole openSUSE from stable to Factory.</p>\n<p>At this point I decided to fuck openSUSE and go back to Kubuntu. Tonight I find out if it can at least burn an iso properly, since it apparently can&#8217;t do much of anything else that I&#8217;ve come to take for granted.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/c53c0870-b604-4ac7-b470-24e8abd5161a/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=c53c0870-b604-4ac7-b470-24e8abd5161a\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5dcc4816-9152-5f82-af0f-b16367068adf"}}
