So far it&#39;s been going on for more than a year but I&#39;ve only really been doing it for four. And let me just tell you, I&#39;m having a blast. It&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess right now, but I might eventually incorporate the challenge into this blog.\n</p>\n<p>\nRead an interesting article over at <a href=\"http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/04/23/231252\" target=\"_blank\">slashdot</a> today and have to admit I haven&#39;t had time to actually read what the article linked to.
