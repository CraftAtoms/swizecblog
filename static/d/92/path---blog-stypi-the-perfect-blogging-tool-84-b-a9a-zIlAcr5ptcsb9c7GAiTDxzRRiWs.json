It&#8217;s supposed to be filling a blank left behind <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Etherpad test\" href=\"http://etherpad.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Etherpad</a> when it chewed up by Google and spat out as <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Wave\" href=\"http://wave.google.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Wave</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3320\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-03-at-4.25.36-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3320\" title=\"This post in Stypi\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-03-at-4.25.36-PM-300x214.png\" alt=\"This post in Stypi\" width=\"300\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-03-at-4.25.36-PM-300x214.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-03-at-4.25.36-PM-1024x730.png 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-03-at-4.25.36-PM.png 1222w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This post in Stypi</p></div>\n<p>Though I&#8217;ve never used Etherpad and have only seen <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"PiratePad\" href=\"http://piratepad.net/\" rel=\"homepage\">Piratepad</a> once or twice I&#8217;ve come to rely on Stypi to produce blogposts.</p>\n<p>The first time I saw Stypi in action was when <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Paul Graham (computer programmer)\" href=\"http://paulgraham.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Paul Graham</a> posted a &#8220;Watch me write&#8221; on hackernews. It was a fascinating look into the way he writes because through Stypi&#8217;s magic we got to watch a playback of one of his essays coming together.</p>\n<p>I remember being amazed by how often he typos not words, but whole paragraphs and started wondering how often I do something similar &#8211; off to Stypi! Been looking for a way to stop using WordPress for content creation for a while anyway.</p>\n<p>At first I watched playbacks of my writing, but soon realised this was about as fun as watching a replay of your rally game &#8211; takes just as long, is super passive and kind of boring &#8230; except in Stypi there aren&#8217;t even any spectacular crashes!</p>\n<p>However, I&#8217;ve come to love Stypi for a different reason &#8211; it&#8217;s the cleanest, most lightweight way to write. Nothing but me and my text.</p>\n<p>&#8230; and anybody who guesses the url I&#8217;m writing at &#8230; One of the main selling points is collaborative editing, but I like to be alone when I write. Sorry Stypi ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Another big selling point for me is that it works _everywhere_. The only contender so far has been iA Writer, but that only works on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mac OS\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\" rel=\"homepage\">MacOS</a> and costs money. But I really enjoy writing on my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Linux\" href=\"http://www.kernel.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">Linux box</a> as well.</p>\n<p>All in all it&#8217;s the perfect drafting tool that really encourages good drafting and rewriting principles. Especially because my better posts take about two or three rewrites before they&#8217;re good enough.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2011/09/26/stypi/\">Stypi founders have a plan to reinvent Google Wave (video)</a> (venturebeat.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/11/four-short-links-10-november-2-2.html\">Four short links: 10 November 2011</a> (radar.oreilly.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/23/y-combinator-demo-day-the-ultimate-roundup/\">Y Combinator Demo Day (S11): The Ultimate Roundup</a> (techcrunch.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/y-combinator-unveils-its-biggest-ever-batch-of-startups-63-companies-2011-8\">Silicon Alley Insider: Y Combinator Unveils Its Biggest-Ever Batch Of Startups: 63 Companies</a> (businessinsider.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://emkaytsg.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/cool-tools/\">Cool Tools</a> (emkaytsg.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://etherpad.org/2011/12/06/etherpad-international-hackathon-2012/\">Etherpad hackathon announced for early 2012</a> (etherpad.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=b930305a-c73b-4500-9936-c43925223b20\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ffe8ebee-0f1c-5899-a0c9-8d7ddb8559a3"}}
