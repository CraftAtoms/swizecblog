Fuck!&#8221;</em> When people use twitter to vent, there are <em>a lot</em> of these. And it&#8217;s getting somewhat annoying, wherefore all the negativity guys?</p>\n<p>I wanted to do something about it. So ~3 weeks ago I decided to start giving complete strangers compliments. Just to see what happens. Either with the strangers I talk to, or with my own attitude towards people (not that there was much wrong with it before).</p>\n<p>At first, I struggled.</p>\n<p>Everyone is so plain and boring! How could I possibly find somebody to compliment every single day? This is impossible, I better quit while I&#8217;m ahead &#8230; and I did quit. For a little while, until I went to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"London\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5072222222,-0.1275&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=51.5072222222,-0.1275 (London)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">London</a> two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>London is a strange city full of interesting people. Surely I&#8217;d manage a compliment there?</p>\n<h2>The Experiences</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img class=\" \" title=\"La Mere Blanc\" src=\"http://lds.localdataimages.com/large/2105/21057650.jpg\" alt=\"La Mere Blanc\" width=\"320\" height=\"240\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">La Mere Blanc</p></div>\n<p>On Friday, 11th of May 2012, at <a href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/la-mere-blanc-london\" target=\"_blank\">La Mere Blanc</a> near <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Vauxhall Bridge\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.4875,-0.126944444444&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=51.4875,-0.126944444444 (Vauxhall%20Bridge)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">Vauxhall Bridge</a> in London, I had just finished my breakfast when I noticed the cashier person has an awesome tattoo. He started punching numbers and all I could think about was <em>&#8220;Is it socially acceptable to comment on a tattoo you can see in a guy&#8217;s cleavage?&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>*ding*, the cash drawer opened<em> should I do it? It&#8217;s a challenge &#8230;</em></p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>I reach for my wallet <em>I mean it&#8217;s just a challenge. For shits and giggles?</em></p>\n<p>I hand him the money, struggling to make eye contact while checking out the tattoo anyway. <em> Should I do it? Will it be weird?</em></p>\n<p>He hands me the change, &#8220;Thanks&#8221;, I say, &#8220;Oh and by the way, your tattoo looks nice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There, it&#8217;s done, reach for the door and I&#8217;m out of here before anything weird happens!</p>\n<p>Instead, &#8220;Oh thanks man! My sister made it, she&#8217;s a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tattoo artist\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoo_artist\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">tattoo artist</a> you know?&#8221;, the cashier said.</p>\n<p>What followed was a five minute conversation about tattoos, his sister as a tattoo artist, and his grandmother who got her first tattoo when she was 65 and just keeps wanting more and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Everything went better than expected!</strong></p>\n<p>Since then, walking  up to complete strangers just to give them compliment has grown increasingly easy. Sometimes the exchange is very brief &#8211; like the case of telling a girl her hair looks nice and her just squeezing a <em>thanks</em> through her breath as she rushed by &#8211; sometimes they turn into whole conversations.</p>\n<p>I had a particularly interesting experience yesterday.</p>\n<p>It was rainy in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ljubljana\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.0555555556,14.5083333333&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=46.0555555556,14.5083333333 (Ljubljana)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">Ljubljana</a> so there weren&#8217;t a lot of people around. By 4pm I was starting to get desperate, interesting people were growing thin and when I did see someone I chickened out, or hesitated for slightly too long until they were gone.</p>\n<p>As I stepped out of a coffee shop there was a lass. She had funky hair. Casually, walking past, I pointed at her and said  <em>&#8220;Hey, you have cool hair!&#8221;</em> and walked off into the sunset. (she smiled and whispered a thanks)</p>\n<p>Except a hundred meters later, I realized I&#8217;d forgotten my umbrella. Went back feeling shy, the girl was still there &#8230; fuck this is going to get awkward!</p>\n<p>This time <em>she</em> was the first to talk to me. Paid me two compliments in fact, tried to keep me in a conversation as long as possible. We even went so far as introducing each other!</p>\n<p>But I was already late for class so all I&#8217;m left with is a name and an image of funky hair &#8211; <em>Mirela</em> &#8230; what an interesting name. There was at least ten more minutes of conversation in the name alone.</p>\n<h2>The Observations</h2>\n<p>While doing the challenge, I&#8217;ve noticed two things:</p>\n<div style=\"width: 170px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/52499764@N00/3933165538\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Cécile, Tattoo Artist - Tattoo Art Fest (009) ...\" src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3508/3933165538_aaa43dd107_m.jpg\" alt=\"Cécile, Tattoo Artist - Tattoo Art Fest (009) ...\" width=\"160\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Cécile, Tattoo Artist - Tattoo Art Fest (009) - 18-20Sep09, Paris (France) (Photo credit: philippe leroyer)</p></div>\n<ol>\n<li>People are a <strong>lot</strong> nicer than you think. Walk up to someone with a smile and something positive to say, you are <em>guaranteed </em>nice things will happen. Nobody will get annoyed, it will <em>not</em> get awkward or weird. Girls especially react well to this, even if you very bluntly say they just look cute.</li>\n<li>I notice people more. The city is no longer a nameless faceless mass of humans rushing past each other, there is some small interesting thing about almost everybody. Some of them are even worth mentioning.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of this might sound touchy feely and kind of lame, but I think not enough people realize they&#8217;re awesome. If I&#8217;m not doing some big startup, I should at least be making the world a better place one simple compliment at a time.</p>\n<p>And you never know where a chance interaction might take you. Some random guy might actually be a big VC just looking for someone like me. Or a girl desperately wanting some company &#8230; or a business owner who needs a freelancer.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.rt.com/news/prime-time/tattoo-convention-moscow-artists-796/\" target=\"_blank\">Top tattoo artists win hearts of Moscow&#8217;s eccentrics</a> (rt.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://coedmagazine.com/2012/05/21/the-new-york-city-tattoo-convention-what-we-overheard/\" target=\"_blank\">The New York City Tattoo Convention: What We Overheard</a> (coedmagazine.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.bellasugar.com/Has-Stranger-Ever-Asked-Where-You-Get-Your-Hair-Done-3249967\" target=\"_blank\">Has a Stranger Ever Asked Where You Get Your Hair Done?</a> (bellasugar.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://donhall.blogspot.com/2012/05/friday-roundup-focus-on-your-humanity.html\" target=\"_blank\">Friday Roundup: Focus on Your Humanity</a> (donhall.blogspot.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.bellasugar.com/Whats-Your-Most-Complimented-Beauty-Feature-15866788\" target=\"_blank\">What&#8217;s Your Most Complimented Beauty Feature?</a> (bellasugar.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=51ba84f5-3a5a-4786-a6b7-2fa39e4883ee\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"34d56e83-82f6-513f-8087-611bcd154760"}}
