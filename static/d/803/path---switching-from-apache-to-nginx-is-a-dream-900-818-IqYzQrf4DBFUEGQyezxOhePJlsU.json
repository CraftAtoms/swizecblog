It was the workhorse of everything from dev environments to production machines serving tens of pages.</p>\n<p>But throughout this love affair there was one constant &#8211; I had to change things.</p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t bad. Of course when you first start using <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/rewrite_engine\" title=\"Rewrite engine\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_engine\">mod_rewrite</a> you&#8217;re going to have to change things and naturally adding a new website on a new domain means changing a few things. No problem here, all natural.</p>\n<p>But still, there was a certain feeling that rose up in me like a mad urge, a feeling of endless power and proportion, a feeling like, hey, I&#8217;ve had sex with this woman a few times, and I quite like it, but there&#8217;s something missing something isn&#8217;t quite right, why can&#8217;t I watch a good movie instead of having this sex thing?</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right, it was the<strong> Sense of Impending Doom. </strong>Because you see dearies, whenever you have to make a small change in the apache configs a small part of your soul dies. You know it&#8217;s supposed to be a small change, you know it&#8217;s supposed to be effortless, but despite having done this countless times, you still waste an hour making everything work.</p>\n<p>This Saturday I finally stomped my foot like a little school girl and said ENOUGH! Then I installed nginx.</p>\n<p>It was a bit daunting at first and I may still not know how to pronounce the name, but I love it. The damn thing is sooper fast and when I had to add a config for a new site &#8230; hah! Took three lines of code, sure it was only for serving static files, but the same thing in apache takes a separate file, then a vhost, then blahlbah. Fuck you!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example, come on, would you see anything so sleek and awesome under Apache? Ever?</p>\n<pre>server {\r\n                listen localhost:80;\r\n                server_name lestat;\r\n\r\n                root /var/www;\r\n                index <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/webserver_directory_index\" title=\"Webserver directory index\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webserver_directory_index\">index.html</a>;\r\n        }</pre>\n<p>Now obviously I don&#8217;t know how to do fancy rewrites and stuff yet, but from what I&#8217;ve seen so far, I think nginx and Swizec are a match made in heaven for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>So there you go @<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Robert Basic\" rel=\"twitter\" href=\"http://twitter.com/robertbasic\">robertbasic</a>, @genom, @loudandwicked, @jaspertandy &#8230; a blog post about the change.</p>\n<p>PS: about versatility and such that @genom mentioned, I haven&#8217;t a bloody clue (yet)</p>\n<p>PS2: apologies to everyone I mentioned in the post and didn&#8217;t link to, Zemanta didn&#8217;t suggest the links and I&#8217;m too lazy to do them manugally.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/03a978c3-1d04-49d7-a49a-ad4251933077/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=03a978c3-1d04-49d7-a49a-ad4251933077\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5f2e2ebd-3a28-51ce-a261-f97c8e6fe125"}}
