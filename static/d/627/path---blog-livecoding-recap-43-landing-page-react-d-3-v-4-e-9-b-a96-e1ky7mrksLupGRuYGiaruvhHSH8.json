Publish a new version on Leanpub, set up a new product on Gumroad, decide Stripe is not the way to go, think about email sequences, andâ€¦ build a landing page.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s where things got hard.</p>\n<p>Building landing pages is hard. It&#8217;s not the building itself that&#8217;s hard. I have a template for that. Itâ€™s a template that I&#8217;ve long since turned into a collection of React components, even.</p>\n<p>Filling those components, that&#8217;s the hard part.</p>\n<p>How do you sell your product? Why would anyone buy what you made? Who are they? What&#8217;s the problem they&#8217;re solving? Are there many problems? What&#8217;s the most common one? How do you explain all of this in a way that makes sense?</p>\n<p>How do you grab someone&#8217;s attention? Are you speaking to your audience or shouting at the void?</p>\n<p><em>That</em> stuff is hard. That stuff right there. Makes me wanna pull my hair out.</p>\n<p>Somewhere, deep down, I think I know the answers to all those questions. But what if I don&#8217;t? What if I&#8217;m wrong.</p>\n<p>I showed <a href=\"https://react-d3js-landing-page-mbnbcvgyit.now.sh/\">what I had so far</a> to a friend, and he said <em>&#8220;Nah, you&#8217;re making me think. Why are you pitching 3 different ways right at the top?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I DONâ€™T KNOW WHY. Because 3 different people buy my book? Because I&#8217;m not saying 3 different things, but it isn&#8217;t coming out well? ðŸ˜­</p>\n<p>This shit&#8217;s hard. I need to spend more time reading books on copywriting. Good copywriting reads almost like poetry, flows like a fairy tale, and makes you want to keep reading and reading. You&#8217;re almost afraid the buy button will come too soon because you&#8217;re enjoying the read so much.</p>\n<p>My copywritingâ€¦ hehâ€¦ my copywriting sounds like you put Hemingway and Godin in a blender and hoped for the best.</p>\n<p>But at least I&#8217;m using the <a href=\"https://antonsten.com/understanding-pain-dream-fix/\">Pain Dream Fix</a> approach. There&#8217;s hope, ya know.</p>\n<p>The idea behind Pain Dream Fix is that your customers have a pain that they&#8217;re looking to solve. They have a dream of what they want to be like. Itâ€™s the superpower they want to have, if you will. And you can offer a fix to their pain that gets them to their dream.</p>\n<p>Sell customers a better version of themselves, not just some product properties. Nobody gives a shit about your product, they&#8217;re in it for themselves. As they should be.</p>\n<p>If all goes well, launch is next week. I can keep improving the landing page for one forever at least.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ff501f40-7e71-5652-9fb1-14feaf29d931"}}
