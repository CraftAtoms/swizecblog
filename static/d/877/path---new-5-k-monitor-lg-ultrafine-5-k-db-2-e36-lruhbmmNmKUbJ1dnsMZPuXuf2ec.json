Watch the video üëÜ</p>\n<p>Got my <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2C3SlsD\">LG UltraFine 5K 27&#8243; from Amazon</a>. Mine was a refurb, so I saved about $500 from full price. Your luck may vary.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick rundown for the impatient üëá</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New office setup with the 5K monitor üëå</p>\n<p>On cable to rule them all <a href=\"https://t.co/uJcVTfUpry\">pic.twitter.com/uJcVTfUpry</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/940112462447198208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>gorgeous picture</li>\n<li><strong>so many</strong> pixels 5120&#215;2880</li>\n<li>seriously, my code looks like it&#8217;s printed on paper üòç</li>\n<li>one cable to rule them all (same cable charges your laptop and connects everything)</li>\n<li>3 USB-C ports, works as a hub</li>\n<li>USB-C connection should have enough bandwidth for a lot of peripherals</li>\n<li><em>amazing</em> built-in speakers, no more muffled bassy sound</li>\n<li>okay webcam</li>\n<li>adjustable height and 2-directional tilt</li>\n<li>light yet sturdy</li>\n<li>design looks üëå</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>USB-C only, you need to buy a hub (I got one with USB + ethernet + SDcards, duct-taped it to the back)</li>\n<li>doesn&#8217;t seem to adjust brightness to ambient light</li>\n<li>13&#8243; macbook pro from 2017 struggles a bit</li>\n<li>15&#8243; macbook pro with top spec GPU can&#8217;t run games in full 5K</li>\n<li>too many pixels, gotta be careful when taking screenshots (must resize, big files)</li>\n<li>super expensive</li>\n<li>completely unnecessary for most daily tasks</li>\n<li>MacOS sometimes does wonky things with USB-C connections like crash your computer if you plug and unplug impatiently</li>\n<li>doesn&#8217;t give you more screen real estate room than a normal 27&#8243; monitor (not at &#8220;native&#8221; resolution at least)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason I went for 5K instead of just 4K are the Amazon reviews that say <em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get a 27&#8243; 4K, MacOS does funny things&#8221;</em>. Something about not being able to run at native resolution so you either get suuuuuper tiny visuals, or everything&#8217;s blurry.</p>\n<p>Your only options are a 24&#8243; 4K or a 27&#8243; 5K. I hear 32&#8243; 4K works great too, but my desk isn&#8217;t big enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>\n<p>2017 is still too early for 5K. There are only 2 monitors on the market, <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2C3SlsD\">the LG</a> and the Dell, and they&#8217;re both expensive as hell. Laptops have trouble driving the full resolution for anything interesting, and you don&#8217;t get more real estate than normal.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a fancy toy, looks great, your eyes will love you. But if you have a working monitor, I&#8217;d wait a few more years for 5K to become the norm.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e6e31820-c670-5394-bef5-a442bc4fd120"}}
