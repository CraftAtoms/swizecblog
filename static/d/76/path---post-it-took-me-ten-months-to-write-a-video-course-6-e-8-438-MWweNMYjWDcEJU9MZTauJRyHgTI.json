I said they lure suckers in with chump change, then make large profits off their endless toil.</p>\n<p>But just a few weeks later I started a new project with my publisher, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Packt\" href=\"http://www.packtpub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Packt</a>. It wasn&#8217;t a book this time, it was a d3.js video course.</p>\n<p>Why?</p>\n<p>Because why not. I&#8217;ve never made a video course before, but have strong opinions on why they suck. And trying out new media is fun.</p>\n<p>If I can make a course that doesn&#8217;t need skimming and doesn&#8217;t make you watch at 1.5x speed, I&#8217;ve won. I basically want to make a course that <em>I would want to watch</em>.</p>\n<p>Well, here we are. Ten months later and the scripts portion is done. Deadlines have long since whooshed by, my editors have given up on keeping a schedule, and I think that officially we are 6 months behind the original estimate.</p>\n<p>They wanted to publish the course in October. It&#8217;s February and I haven&#8217;t started recording.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p>Maybe I did dawdle. Just over 310 hours have gone into the writing of the scripts. An average of just an hour and a bit a day.</p>\n<p>Such lazy.</p>\n<p>Writing my d3.js book, <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/data-visualization-d3js\">Data Visualization with d3.js</a>, the overall average ended up the same. But disregard the months of downtime between revisions, I invested three times as much daily effort into the book.</p>\n<p>I mean, let&#8217;s be real here. Writing this video course I was so lazy and in such creative despair, that one time a higher up editor sent me an email saying <em>&#8220;So err, dude, we haven&#8217;t heard from you in like two months. Are you alive?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah. That bad.</p>\n<p>But I got it the fuck done! The scripts are finished. They are 32,000 words long, and they are good. I think.</p>\n<p>As much time has gone just into writing the scripts as it did into the book start to publish. I&#8217;ll be damned if I get another stinging review like this one:</p>\n<blockquote><p>the content is weak and looks more like a me too, rushed approach.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Seriously, screw you guy. That hurt. It was my first book and I slaved over that stupid thing for a year. Cut me some slack here!</p>\n<p>As for the scripts, my editor is encouraging:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There isn&#8217;t much feedback, the reviewers like the scripts as is(Can&#8217;t say that I am surprised, your scripts were brilliant!)</p></blockquote>\n<p>But there is an estimated 220 minutes of material there. Three and a half hours. They asked for two hours &#8230; oops.</p>\n<p>Now I just hope my video recording and editing skills will be up to snuff. If this comes out as good as it looks in my head, it&#8217;s going to be awesome.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a1fc77c8-493f-55cd-83dd-5dece7dd42e0"}}
