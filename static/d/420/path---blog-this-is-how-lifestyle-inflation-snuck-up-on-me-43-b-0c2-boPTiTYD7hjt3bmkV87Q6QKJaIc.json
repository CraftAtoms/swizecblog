Splurging makes me twitch, expensive things make me uncomfortable, and if something costs more than ‚Ç¨20, I better well use it every day until it dies. But four years ago the limit was 5 euro.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s how lifestyle inflation creeps up when you least expect it.</p>\n<p>You work and you work, and money doesn&#8217;t pile up. You make two times, three times, even four times as much as you used to, and the savings just aren&#8217;t there.</p>\n<p>For the past three years I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to do quite well for myself.</p>\n<p>My savings went from <em>&#8220;Why is there so much month at the end of the money&#8221;</em> to <em>&#8220;If I run out of work I&#8217;m proooobably going to be fine for a month or two&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not much savings even for a 27 year old. All of a sudden many of my friends are thinking about <em>buying</em> real-estate, starting families, and becoming Real People &#8482;.</p>\n<p>And here I am, looking at the last four years of <a href=\"http://toshl.com/\">Toshl</a> data in disbelief. I&#8217;ve built a habit of noting every cent I spend.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s horrifying.</p>\n<p>In the whole of 2011 I spent just ‚Ç¨4,500. Living at home, sure. Mum paying most of my expenses, yes. Student life, nice and cheap.</p>\n<p>In 2014 I spent that much <em>every month</em>. Every. Single. Month. It beggars belief.</p>\n<p>How the hell did I go from ‚Ç¨4,500 per year to ‚Ç¨60,000 per year in just four years? 1300% O.o</p>\n<p>Well, a few things <em>have</em> changed.</p>\n<p>First of all, I&#8217;m no longer a student. In 2012 I started a company and began paying my fair share of taxes, welfare contributions, and pension. That&#8217;s about a grand a month these days.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I moved out of my mum&#8217;s place, spent a bunch of time abroad, and built a bit of a nomadic lifestyle. Rent was over 10,000 last year, plane tickets just over 2,200.</p>\n<p>That might seem cheap if you&#8217;re reading from SF. But I assure you, it&#8217;s quite steep when compared to nothing.</p>\n<p>My fixed expenses have gone from from ‚Ç¨1,390 in 2012, to ‚Ç¨18,740 in 2014. 1340%. Adulting is hard. üòê</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s only so much I can do about that. I like being in SF as much as possible. Rent is high. If I want to afford the rent, I have to make more. That makes my taxes and welfare contributions go up as well.</p>\n<p>And then I have to make even more money. And more. And more. And suddenly I understand why it&#8217;s called a rat race.</p>\n<p>Maybe I should switch to capital gains. But I don&#8217;t have the money for capital gains. And I can&#8217;t save up starting capital to switch to capital gains because the more I make, the more I spend.</p>\n<p>Poo.</p>\n<p>But maybe I should look at the ‚Ç¨3,000 I spent in restaurants last year, the ‚Ç¨2,000 I spent on sports, the ‚Ç¨1,600 I spent on online services, the ‚Ç¨1,000 I spent on taxis, the ‚Ç¨1,400 I spent on partying, and certainly the ‚Ç¨1,300 I spent on &#8220;misc&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Man, that lifestyle inflation snuck up on me out of nowhere. Because what&#8217;s a ‚Ç¨20 here and a ‚Ç¨20 there, right?</p>\n<p>And somewhere in the back of my mind I hear Mum screaming <em>&#8220;Budgets!&#8221;</em>.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"111438f8-3ad5-5092-921e-2cf445a10611"}}
