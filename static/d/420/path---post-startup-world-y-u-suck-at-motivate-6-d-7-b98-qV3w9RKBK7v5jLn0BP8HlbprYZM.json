That thing a trainer tells you before a big match to pump you up, to make you want to win, that burst of immediate motivation you need to overcome your own limits and win.</p>\n<p>Watch any movie about sports, at one point the hero will want to pussy out, defeated by their own body. Somebody will give them a passionate motivational speech and the hero triumphs. <em>Emotion</em>. <em>Power. Glory.</em></p>\n<p>Startuppers &#8230; well, when somebody flounders, we give them advice. Weak, wimpy, <em>advice.</em> Fuck emotion right? Fuck passion, passion isn&#8217;t something you <em>have</em> passion is something you <strong>talk about having</strong>.</p>\n<p>Screw you.</p>\n<p>Inspiration is good! Inspiration is great! But before doing that important sales pitch, before walking into that VC&#8217;s office, before tackling that bug in your code, before quitting your job to do your own thing &#8230; that&#8217;s when you need <em>motivation</em>.</p>\n<p>I could hypothesize for hours about why athletes [and some other physical disciplines] are so great at motivation and startuppers suck &#8230; maybe immediate goals are easier to define, perhaps being pumped and ready to kill doesn&#8217;t benefit us.</p>\n<p>But you know what? None of that matters.</p>\n<p>Before your next coding session, before that important 5 minute pitch, listen to these! Last night they helped me <em>destroy</em> 300 SQL queries for a request and shave off 5 seconds of load time.</p>\n<p><a title=\"HOW GREAT I AM [unembeddable]\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6xLYt265ZM\" target=\"_blank\">HOW GREAT I AM [unembeddable]</a></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Obo6xCAHIG8\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yX39J_YyKbs\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://zakhomuth.com/sad-tired-and-alone-my-ongoing-battle-with-st-39237\">Sad, Tired, and Alone: My Ongoing Battle With Startup Depression</a> (zakhomuth.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://epodcastnetwork.com/energizing-your-group-with-a-motivational-speech/\">Energizing Your Group with a Motivational Speech</a> (epodcastnetwork.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://booksandbabbling.wordpress.com/2012/03/08/getting-motivated/\">Getting motivated</a> (booksandbabbling.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://juangreatleap.com/2011/12/03/selecting-the-right-lightbulb-evaluating-startup-ideas-part-i/\">ENSURING YOUR STARTUP IDEA DOESN&#8217;T SUCK, Part 1</a> (juangreatleap.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.humbledmba.com/how-to-find-a-business-cofounder-that-doesnt\">How to find a business cofounder that doesn&#8217;t suck</a> (humbledmba.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://upfrontmenblog.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/the-essential-keys-to-self-improvement-and-motivation/\">The Essential Keys to Self-Improvement and Motivation</a> (upfrontmenblog.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=75f57aef-c2be-43cb-93a0-e073cd328e54\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"12df8013-f9b8-5164-a740-c244d8dc041f"}}
