It corresponds nicely with the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Academic term\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_term\" rel=\"wikipedia\">school year</a> and how <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Test (assessment)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_%28assessment%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">exams</a> are laid out.</p>\n<p>But this time the post is going to be different:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>this is not a rant</li>\n<li>this does not propose a solution</li>\n<li>this is just a set of observations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To give a bit of background: last year I advanced into the next year (set of two semesters) of my course through a little bit of dumb luck because the terms of advancing were lowered somewhat so enough of us could get through to fill up the year. This meant that I had a lot of exams left over and through naught other than poor planning, too many difficult exams stacked up to September and I subsequently failed catastrophically and was forced to transfer to a three year bachelor&#8217;s course within a new education system.</p>\n<p>Wow &#8230; that was a mouthful. I hope anyone understood even a fragment of that.</p>\n<p>And now the observations:<!--more--></p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have always been very interested in learning new things. Spending frustrating amounts of time to figure out how something works has never been a problem and I have probably spent more time learning things on my own than in a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Education\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education\" rel=\"wikipedia\">formal education</a> setting.</li>\n<li>I have never been very good at passing exams of any kind. If you ask me to display a certain skill at a particular moment in time &#8230; I will fail. The last time this wasn&#8217;t a problem was in 5th grade of primary school. Why, I don&#8217;t know.</li>\n<li>I have always had trouble following a forced pace of learning. It tends to be too generally applicative and usually ends up being too slow for me. Because it doesn&#8217;t tax me enough, I tend to drift away and start learning things on my own. Then I get pulled away by learning shiny cool things and forget to follow along with the formal education. (like when you&#8217;re reading a book and your mind drifts)</li>\n<li>Invariably because I don&#8217;t follow along a formal class eventually surpasses my ability to quickly get back on track and I fall behind.</li>\n<li>I can usually learn a whole semester worth of a formal class in about two weeks of concentrated studying, but exams are always set up in such a way as to make it impossible to concentrate on a single class for two weeks &#8230; you&#8217;re supposed to follow along for the whole 3 months.</li>\n<li>I get genuinely excited about most theoretical and practical things they want to teach/show us at school</li>\n<li>The productive output of most of my classmates is abysmal</li>\n<li>The forced productive output of most of my classmates makes me want to scream when I look at it</li>\n<li>Most of my classmates get genuinely frustrated when asked to produce something significant-ish or learn a completely new concept</li>\n<li>A lot of my classmates passed their exams and advanced into the next year. Even the ones I have personally worked with on coursework and shouldn&#8217;t be more than freshmen if it were up to me</li>\n<li>A favourite professor of mine can&#8217;t hold class this year because the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Peer review\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review\" rel=\"wikipedia\">peer review process</a> in his field is slow and he didn&#8217;t meet some arbitrarily defined quota for published articles</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can draw your own conclusions. Mine is that the education system as I know it is designed to prefer a different set of skills than I posses and for whatever reason I have so far been unable to hack the system to my advantage.</p>\n<p>But I shan&#8217;t let this discourage me. I&#8217;m going to graduate with a bachelor&#8217;s in computer science by next October if it kills me &#8230; even if I originally signed up for a master&#8217;s equivalent.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dougbelshaw.com/blog/2011/10/02/what-did-we-learn-during-a-semester-of-learning-on-openbadges-over-at-p2pu-org/\">What did we learn during a &#8216;semester of learning&#8217; on #openbadges over at P2PU.org?</a> (dougbelshaw.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/8790219/Ofqual-pupils-to-sit-end-of-course-exams-in-GCSE-overhaul.html&amp;a=56349834&amp;rid=12e58db3-0284-45bd-89fb-8ec7d196d2a6&amp;e=5a9b97ac01528ab2a58db3ce37412cb8\">Ofqual: pupils to sit end-of-course exams in GCSE overhaul</a> (telegraph.co.uk)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://beautifoolmind.wordpress.com/2011/09/29/a-world-with-no-exams/\">A World With No Exams!</a> (beautifoolmind.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.downes.ca/post/56328/rd\">Invisible Learning, Aprendizaje Invisible</a> (downes.ca)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jameslcarey.com/2011/10/03/todays-gripe-the-end-of-excellence/\">Today&#8217;s Gripe: The End of Excellence</a> (jameslcarey.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.bripblap.com/friday-quote-self-education/\">friday quote: self-education</a> (bripblap.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://bloomsight.wordpress.com/2011/10/02/education-a-poem/\">Education, a poem.</a> (bloomsight.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=12e58db3-0284-45bd-89fb-8ec7d196d2a6\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4f330216-afb6-5c30-b8f6-62c484402b83"}}
