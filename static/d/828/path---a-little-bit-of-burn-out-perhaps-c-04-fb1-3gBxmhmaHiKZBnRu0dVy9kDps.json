And I just didn&#8217;t do anything very productive at all for some reason. Whenever I did do some work it was at a slow leisurely pace. A few clicks here. Tap tap there. Point point test yonder.</p>\n<p>Like, for example, instead of working hard on building a testing framework for my machine learning frameworks last night I &#8230; invited the girlfriend over, had a nice and comfortable dinner (unfortunately not a very tasty one) then watched a movie or somesuch and went to bed earlier than midnight.</p>\n<p>No, cuddling is not being productive.</p>\n<p>And today we watched television, TELEVISION, until something like 12 o&#8217;clock and went off into the great wide open to find new adventures.</p>\n<p>Yep, the whole week has been one big lazy yawn with a bit of running and exercise and a little productivity. Hell, it&#8217;s already Thursday and I&#8217;ve only been productive 43 hours this week! Ew! If I didn&#8217;t love it so much I&#8217;d almost be disgusted with myself.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block; float: left\">\n<div>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31355686@N00/2715700690\"><img title=\"20080523 - computer - 1 - 157-5735 - stickers\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/2715700690_c7f92c51d2_m.jpg\" alt=\"20080523 - computer - 1 - 157-5735 - stickers\" width=\"240\" height=\"156\" /></a></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd zemanta-img-attribution\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31355686@N00/2715700690\">Rev.

I don&#8217;t really deal well with proper vacations, get too bored. So this is perfect for me, have a week like normal people for once.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s nice. Guilty pleasures are always the bestest.</p>\n<p>Do people really survive their whole lives on only 9-ish hours of productivity every day <em>excluding</em> weekends?</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if I can really believe that &#8230; someone enlighten me.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/e75fbbbc-72f4-4135-9719-2426e4b36267/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=e75fbbbc-72f4-4135-9719-2426e4b36267\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"57f53f6a-72cc-573c-bb8f-e144a14ba4cc"}}
