{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Two business things Slovenia needs to change","content":"<p>This post is aimed at my local readers, the rest can look at it as a curiosity from an awesome small country that is fumbling all over itself trying to be even awesomer.</p>\n<h2>Slave labor</h2>\n<p>We don&#8217;t have Mexicans, but we do have <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Student\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student\" rel=\"wikipedia\">students</a>. A whole <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Caste\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste\" rel=\"wikipedia\">social caste</a> of people ripe for abuse because they don&#8217;t realize their worth and hey, what better way to keep operating costs low than to employ a bunch of these guys, pay them below-minimum wage and tell them it&#8217;s even worse elsewhere?</p>\n<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/36988361@N08/4296232936\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Students in the incubation room at the Woodbin...\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/4296232936_fb73460a56_m12.jpg\" alt=\"Students in the incubation room at the Woodbin...\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students in the incubation room at the Woodbine Agricultural School, New Jersey (Photo credit: Center for Jewish History, NYC)</p></div>\n<p>Not cool!</p>\n<p>Originally student work was invented to give students some degree of autonomy, to make getting through college cheaper and easier. It&#8217;s since been quite corrupted &#8230; whole companies running on nothing but <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Slavery\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery\" rel=\"wikipedia\">slave labor</a>.</p>\n<p>My recent survey about <a href=\"http://swiz.ec/yhzzr7\" target=\"_blank\">how much money comp sci students make</a> shows that most make less than 10 euro an hour, glaringly obvious even on just a cursory glance.</p>\n<p>These aren&#8217;t internships mind you. A lot of them are full blown computer engineers, often-times making companies&#8217; core products completely on their own or with a help of a couple other students.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s sickening.</p>\n<p>Even worse is that when I published the survey, a lot of students pinged me and said <em>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t you think you set the bar somewhat high? Most of us don&#8217;t even make the 7 euro lower bound you set up &#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>No, for fuck&#8217;s sake no! This is money we&#8217;re talking about! You shouldn&#8217;t be paid how much everyone else is being paid, this isn&#8217;t some competition in fairness, this is cold hard cash! Demand to be fucking paid how much you are worth to the company.</p>\n<p>I can (sort of) understand a waiter working for 4 or 5 euro an hour. But anyone paying less than 10 for any nongeneric type of service should be laughed out of business.</p>\n<p>And <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Businessperson\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Businessperson\" rel=\"wikipedia\">business people</a> &#8230; shame on you!</p>\n<p>If you get a student who is any good and they timidly ask for 7 euro an hour because they consider that quite a bit of money. Tell them they&#8217;re being stupid and demand to give them 15 euro. Congratulations, you just earned an extremely happy and loyal worker. And it&#8217;s still cheaper than giving them full employment.</p>\n<p>When paying students, always keep in mind they rarely work more than half-time. They need to make a living off this!</p>\n<h2>Speed of business</h2>\n<p>Another thing that really gets on my nerves in Slovenia is that everything is <em>so slow</em>. Sending an invoice to a client in Slovenia feels like sending it down a black hole.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/24549021@N08/2342478549\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Invoice, Chas M Stieff Manufacturer of Grand &amp;...\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/2342478549_6175f46fd8_m13.jpg\" alt=\"Invoice, Chas M Stieff Manufacturer of Grand &amp;...\" width=\"240\" height=\"185\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Invoice, Chas M Stieff Manufacturer of Grand &amp; Upright Pianos (Photo credit: Lynchburg College Archives)</p></div>\n<p>The average response time I&#8217;ve experienced is &#8230; <em>a long time</em>. Hell, I am legally mandated to give you two weeks of time to pay up and most <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Business\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\" rel=\"wikipedia\">businesses</a> are very <em>very </em>careful not to pay anything sooner than that. The problem is so big the only thing <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Students' union\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students%27_union\" rel=\"wikipedia\">student unions</a> do is make sure people get paid quickly by just fronting the cash.</p>\n<p>I checked. There are <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Invoice\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invoice\" rel=\"wikipedia\">invoices</a> from <em>a year ago</em> that are still marked as &#8220;fronted by student union&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Sickening!</p>\n<p>You know what happens when you send an invoice to a proper country? You get paid the next day. Last night someone wired me the money literally 20 minutes after I clicked <em>send</em> on the invoice email.</p>\n<p>Of course then I had to wait roughly 15 hours for my bank to actually process the transfer of a few electrons &#8230;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Slovenia is awesome and I love it to bits, but I sure as hell get the feeling it doesn&#8217;t want me here. And hey, the top of the crop of our entrepreneurs, businesses and pretty much anyone worth their salt &#8230; is leaving.</p>\n<p>I wonder why.</p>\n<p>PS: if looking at the data from that survey makes me any angrier I will hurt people.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/the-only-island-in-slovenia-may-be-the-most-awesome-private-island-in-the-world-2012-2\">The Only Island In Slovenia May Be The Most Awesome Private Island In The World</a> (businessinsider.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://studenteventsblog.wordpress.com/2012/02/06/student-unions/\">Student Unions</a> (studenteventsblog.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/7/prweb8649378.htm\">Slo(www)Bus for Playful Exploration of Slovenia</a> (prweb.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2016937139_apeusloveniawomenmps.html?syndication=rss\">Record number of women in Slovenia parliament</a> (seattletimes.nwsource.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=51092f8d-c661-4e48-aea8-c95c26dac146\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"56641ee5-d97d-58ab-914a-957743bb61a6"}}
