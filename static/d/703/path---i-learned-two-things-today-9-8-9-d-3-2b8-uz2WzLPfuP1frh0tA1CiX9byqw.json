Finally broke down after almost two months of going practically without chocolate (I usually make at least a nibble a day) for almost two months and I just had to buy some. The selection at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market\">Whole Foods</a> is surprisingly opulent, but very expensive because everything is magically organic and fancy.</p>\n<p>In the end I settled on two bars of some brand I&#8217;ve never heard of that seemed reasonable. Surprisingly enough, chocolate with the flavour of peanuts and salt is pretty damn tasty.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I learned today is that <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Foursquare\" href=\"http://www.foursquare.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Foursquare</a> has shut down its original <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Application programming interface\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\">API</a> and now only supports the new version. Was fixing up my blog after javascript broke horrifically and my mixpanel metrics weren&#8217;t collecting properly, half of the footer was missing and so on.</p>\n<p>Well I have a small widget that displays my last foursquare checkin. The checkin doesn&#8217;t appear now and after a very long time debugging I finally got to a Foursquare error message saying, essentially, &#8220;This version no longer works. Please kindly fuck off&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Wonder how many apps that breaks.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-2-8/swizec/2059\">I learned two things today 2.8.</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://sophisticatedspender.com/2011/08/08/what-i-learned-from-my-dc-chocolate-tour/\">What I Learned From My DC Chocolate Tour</a> (sophisticatedspender.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.ilyke.net/view/2332\">Did you know Chocolate is a Vegetable?</a> (ilyke.net)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=607e016a-df19-4035-8a21-1bcbbf598174\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"80cb75ff-2800-53e0-93c1-9effd7ab7909"}}
