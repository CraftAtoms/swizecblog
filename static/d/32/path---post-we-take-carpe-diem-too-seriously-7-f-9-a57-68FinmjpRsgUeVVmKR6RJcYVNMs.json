Dude, I get a day off almost every month.</em></p>\n<p>This was different &#8211; I had a day off from <em>me</em>.</p>\n<p>None of my little rituals. No exercise in the morning. Not a single cup of tea. No jotting down random-ish actions into <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Daytum\" href=\"http://www.daytum.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Daytum</a>. No tweeting. No instagraming. No marking down every bite into <a href=\"http://www.myfitnesspal.com/\" target=\"_blank\">myfitnesspal</a>. No time trackers. No email. Nothing.</p>\n<p>Even wrote the <a href=\"http://750words.com/\" target=\"_blank\">750words</a> at almost midnight.</p>\n<p>For a whole day I completely threw away every little thing I do day after day that doesn&#8217;t bring a rush of oxytocin there and then. Yes, I will continue doing all those things today, no, none of it is particularly useful, yes, they all tickle the nerd inside me.</p>\n<p>I took one more step. I didn&#8217;t worry about the pile of email I&#8217;d return to. The day&#8217;s lull in my data, or the delay in stuff I&#8217;m working on.</p>\n<p>A day like there&#8217;s no tomorrow! Carpe Diem is fine and all, but dear god we all take it so seriously. When did we collectively forget to <em>enjoy ourselves</em>? That Carpe Diem wasn&#8217;t [just] about working day and night to get the upper hand on your competition &#8230;</p>\n<p>It felt great and against all expectations, my life is not a barren wasteland today.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t devolve into a fumbling beast, all my good [and bad] habits are still there. I&#8217;m still posting my daily blog. Still tweeting like mad. And still dutifully recording all the useless data about my life. I will even do some work despite Jan 2nd being a public holiday.</p>\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t do anything even remotely like this yesterday &#8211; shame on you! You&#8217;re an even bigger nutcase than I am!</p>\n<p>Give it a try tomorrow, I dare you.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://hopenrecovery.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/carpe-diem-2012/\">Carpé Diem 2012</a> (hopenrecovery.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://stephenhilder.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/carpediem/\">Carpe Diem</a> (stephenhilder.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://rd2recovery.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/carpe-diem-2012/\">Carpé Diem 2012</a> (rd2recovery.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jpshealthylivingblog.wordpress.com/2011/12/30/2012-goals/\">2012 Goals</a> (jpshealthylivingblog.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=3b8af50e-bc08-48b8-af2f-82f257294ca0\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b8fab6ed-f5e1-5673-a928-212b197061f2"}}
