{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Cold","content":"<p>\n Yes, it got cold outside, last week the average temperature was 15&deg;C and now this week around 0&deg;C &#8230; thank you global warming, we love you man. But seriously, I very much love cold, there&#39;s just something about it that is so very much better than heat. Maybe it&#39;s all the fun I derive from being properly clad, or maybe it&#39;s that I don&#39;t get my eyes poked out by boobies wherever they turn. Yes, severe cold, that&#39;s just bad and unenjoyable, it usually also hurts.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are some unique problems related to col, though, that are not apparent in warmness. There is for example the ever looming, low to the ground, winter sun &#8230; that thing is just annoying with it&#39;s desire to kill people&#39;s eyes, why, why do you have to do it you silly thing! Another is the fact that my favourite tea procuring building is always full, especially when I want to go in for a cup. See, I love tea, and I do great work at tea shops, but it&#39;s difficult to do when there is nowhere to sit down and actually have that tea. Stupid too small place.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f9afdb23-939d-59eb-94d6-68a20f206ca7"}}
