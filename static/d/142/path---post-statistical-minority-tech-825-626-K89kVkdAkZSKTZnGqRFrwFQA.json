Grouping by nationality, he said, is too arbitrary. You can&#8217;t just conjure arbitrary identities so you can feel special.</p>\n<p>Even my dear girlfriend once said that I don&#8217;t get to identify as a minority. I am a white male, and that&#8217;s that.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7792\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ljubljana.jpg\" width=\"740\" height=\"494\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ljubljana.jpg 740w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ljubljana-300x200.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" />\n<p>Before I ever became a white male, I was Slovenian. Part of a small nation tucked away between the Alps and the Adriatic. It represents just 0.03% of the world&#8217;s population.<sup><a id=\"ffn1\" href=\"#fn1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p>With a uniform distribution of tech talent, you would expect to see around 180,000 Slovenians in tech globally.<sup><a id=\"ffn2\" href=\"#fn2\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Statistics Bureau of Slovenia says there are about 23,000 Slovenians in tech. If you generously add another 5,000 to account for the Slovenian diaspora<sup><a id=\"ffn3\" href=\"#fn3\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup>, that makes 28,000.</p>\n<p>28,000 is a whole order of magnitude less than 180,000. If the goal of tech is total inclusivity and equal opportunity for all, where are all the Slovenians?</p>\n<p>Â¯&#92;_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</p>\n<p>Some four years ago, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. According to the napkin math, I could expect to find some 400 Slovenians in the local tech scene. 7,150,000<sup><a id=\"ffn4\" href=\"#fn4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> * .2 <sup><a id=\"ffn5\" href=\"#fn5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> * .0003 = ~400</p>\n<p>I think even 100 is pushing it. I know of around 30 who live here and maybe another 30 who visit regularly.</p>\n<h2>What that looks like in practice</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7793\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/not-all-slovenians.jpg\" width=\"334\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/not-all-slovenians.jpg 334w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/not-all-slovenians-300x271.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px\" />\n<p>Nobody discriminates against us. There&#8217;s no precedent. Say you&#8217;re from Slovenia and it&#8217;s the same as saying you&#8217;re from some random town nobody&#8217;s heard of.</p>\n<p>But that does make me everybody&#8217;s token Slovenian.</p>\n<p>Go to a tech event and the conversation always involves the bit where somebody asks <em>&#8220;Whoa, where is YOUR accent from?&#8221;</em> â€¦ uh, Slovenia â€¦ <em>&#8220;Whaaat!? That&#8217;s so cool! What&#8217;s Slovenia?&#8221;</em> â€¦ uh, small country next to Italy â€¦ <em>&#8220;That&#8217;s so radical. Iâ€™ve always wanted to visit Italy! Are you close to Venice? Have you been? What&#8217;s the weather like? Why are you here?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, Venice is a 2 hour drive away from home. No, that&#8217;s considered very far. I&#8217;ve only been twice. No, I promise you, you wouldn&#8217;t go every weekend if you lived there.</p>\n<p>From that moment onward, I am <em>THE</em> Slovenian. Whatever I do and say becomes the lens through which they judge all of Slovenia. Kinda cool, but also kinda burdensome. After the thousandth time, it also gets tiring.</p>\n<p>Imagine you were a woman and everyone you met said things like <em>&#8220;Oh wow a woman in tech! What&#8217;s it like? Are all women just like you?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>I was at a conference once where another Slovenian showed up. Completely unrelated. It just so happened that there were two of us.</p>\n<p>Every conversation had this bit: <em>&#8220;Holy shit, you&#8217;re Slovenian! OMG have you said hi to the other Slovenian yet? Do you know each other? THAT&#8217;S SO COOL THERE&#8217;S TWO OF YOU OMG!! Come let me go get him, you two can chat&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>ðŸ™„</p>\n<p>Imagine doing that to a black person. <em>&#8220;Dude whaaat you&#8217;re black!? I know this other black person! Do you know them? Let me go get them, you two can talk about being black&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all well intentioned, I know. Everybody means well. They&#8217;re excited that they discovered something new. It&#8217;s cool. But I&#8217;ve had this conversation with exactly everybody I met in the past 4 years of my life.</p>\n<h2>Does that make me a minority?</h2>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n<p>I <em>am</em> both white and a dude. So maybe not?</p>\n<p>Not until I open my mouth at least. Not until I have no shared history with anyone and it&#8217;s difficult to relate with anyone. Not until I experience every same thing that all minorities experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of [global] role models? Check.</strong> Growing up, how many Slovenians do you think I saw in Hollywood or world-class sports or leading global corporations? Not many.</p>\n<p>One actress made it in Hollywood by the time I was 26. She had a role in Wolf of Wall Street. Her whole thing was <em>&#8220;You&#8217;re Slovenian! You can help us smuggle money because you speak so many languages. It&#8217;s perfect!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>ðŸ™„</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s rumors that another Slovenian actress in Hollywood existed in the 1920&#8217;s. We have people in the NBA and such, and they&#8217;re national heroes. No superstar global entrepreneurs, especially not in tech.</p>\n<p>We had our first unicorn exit 3 months ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Nobody famous looks/identifies like me? Check.</strong> At home, this isn&#8217;t a problem. We have plenty of famous Slovenians in Slovenia. On the global stage? Nah.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of resources in youth? Kinda.</strong> We&#8217;re a post-socialist country that only became a country when I was 4 years old. Our entire GDP is less than what Apple makes in three months. How many resources do you <em>think</em> I had?</p>\n<p>My family did okay for our locale and situation, but compared to somebody growing up in suburban America? Ha!</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of shared history and experience? Yes.</strong> There&#8217;s about 100 other Slovenians in a 500-mile radius. There&#8217;s <em>nobody</em> I can chat with about common experiences and stuff. There aren&#8217;t even enough of us to form support structures based on identity.</p>\n<p>At such a small scale, inter-personal dynamics and individual friendships trump anything identity based.</p>\n<p><strong>Lack of or bad perception in media? Uh-huh.</strong> Because Slovenia is so small, we become grouped with other Slavs in popular culture. You know what Slavs do in US media?</p>\n<p>Slavs are either janitors or part of the Russian mafia. They wear tracksuits, speak in a funny accent, and do stupid shit on dashcams. They&#8217;re also always drunk and maybe a little dirty.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"580\" height=\"326\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRIsC764Nn4?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s even a standup about it. It&#8217;s funny.</p>\n<p>But worry not. I will continue to be your token Slovenian.
