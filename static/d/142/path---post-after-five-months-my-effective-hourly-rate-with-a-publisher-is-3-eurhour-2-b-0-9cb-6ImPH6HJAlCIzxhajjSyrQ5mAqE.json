{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"After five months, my effective hourly rate with a publisher is 3eur/hour","content":"<p>A while ago I wrote <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-with-d3js/book\">a book about creating d3.js visualizations</a>. You can read about the writing, editing, and hair-pulling part of the process, <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-published-a-book-with-a-publisher-heres-what-the-journey-was-like/swizec/6398\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>By the time it was published, I no longer liked my book. The didactic approach needed work, the examples were kind of meh, and too much of the content had to be breezy. When a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Publishing\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">publisher</a> gets a fixed idea about book length, pushback is hard. Still managed to make it 70 pages longer than they wanted, though.</p>\n<p>Either way, the book has been out for five months now and with no word from the publisher, I was certain it tanked. An utter failure.</p>\n<p><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Packt\" href=\"http://www.packtpub.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Packt</a>&#8216;s official statement on keeping me in the loop was, <em>&#8220;You will get a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Royalties\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royalties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">royalty</a> statement every quarter&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Gee, thanks. That is very satisfying to both my inner data nerd and my ego. But probably good for peace of mind.</p>\n<p>Other than a <em>&#8220;Hey we have some errata&#8221;</em> every once in a while, the book became completely invisible to me after publication. Just floating in the aether doing &#8230; something.</p>\n<p>No discernible buzz. No marketing that I could see. For some reason I haven&#8217;t even seen the book yet. I literally have <em>no</em> idea how this thing turned out.</p>\n<p>In December the first royalty statement arrived.</p>\n<img title=\"First royalty statement\" alt=\"First royalty statement\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13110?token=emav--271JLRZsfuzFSKa2u506z7dR5_TBM9Es5v4BCAnuaSzV8WoiYV-nydnRPPt9HNSKLt5NaBF2f3SxfkpII\" />\n<p>Great, the book sold exactly ten copies in its first month. And that means I made a negative 101 euro &#8230; perfect. Just perfect.</p>\n<p>I was right confused, so I asked what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hello Sir, Thanks for sending in your query . We have forwarded your query to the accounts team and will get back to you as soon a we receive an update. Thanks. Regards, Invoices Team</p></blockquote>\n<p>They never got back.</p>\n<p>At this point I was well bummed. The book surely a massive flop. Every time the editor contacted me about errata he&#8217;d open with <em>&#8220;First of all I would like to congratulate you on the success of your book Data Visualization with d3.js.&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>Psssht, yeah right. Sure.</p>\n<p>But two weeks ago I get an alert email from my bank. <em>&#8220;577 euro has just been deposited to your account&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>U wot m8?</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t remember sending out any invoices. What is this mystery money? Where&#8217;s it from? How am I going to explain this to the tax agency? What is going on here!?</p>\n<p>And sure enough, a few days later &#8211; new royalty statement from Packt.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 866px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Winter royalty statement\" alt=\"Winter royalty statement\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/13111?token=d1Gyw513Z-0bZDb6px3NH6b_Xc6WX1UNF_8SDKKzYusSWR0yiFG8whKUTQzZccyVe1gIMhVAu-IGdBf_7bWE9ms\" width=\"856\" height=\"482\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Winter royalty statement</p></div>\n<p>Hey now, that&#8217;s much better! 943 copies sold across all versions.</p>\n<p>Almost 600 euro made. Time to celebrate!</p>\n<p>But then again, total revenue was almost 6400 euro &#8230; damn son. Not sure where all that money is going, but my chunk of the pie suddenly looks miniscule. And I <em>think</em> I did most of the work.</p>\n<p>What really hurts though is that advance. You&#8217;ll see the whole advance Packt gave me to write a book came <strong>from my own damn pocket</strong>. Fuckers!</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d <em>think</em> a royalty advance is something the publisher invests in a book. Nope. They take it right back as soon as they can.</p>\n<p>That means I&#8217;ve made about 1020 euro so far, Putting my effective hourly rate at 3 euro an hour. I&#8217;d be making more weighing tables at rundown restaurants. Tips not included.</p>\n<p>Not sure how I feel about this.</p>\n<p>PS: I&#8217;m giving a talk about writing my first technical book (this one) at this year&#8217;s <a href=\"http://conf.writethedocs.org/eu/2014/\">Write The Docs in Budapest</a>. If you&#8217;re going to be there, I want to buy you a beer.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d8bc3227-47c5-4cc4-b4b9-0c9a79b1c88f\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e844ce58-fe36-504e-8c6e-1713905390d6"}}
