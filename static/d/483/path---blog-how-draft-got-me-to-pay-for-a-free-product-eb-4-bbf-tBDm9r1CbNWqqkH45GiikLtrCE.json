{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"How Draft got me to pay for a free product","content":"<p><a href=\"https://draftin.com/\">Draft</a> is a marvelous new webservice for writing. A bit like iA Writer, but for the browser.</p>\n<p>I <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/stypi-the-perfect-blogging-tool/swizec/3312\">love</a> <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/cool-thing-thursday-ia-writer/swizec/5517\">distraction-free</a> writing and I&#8217;ve recently come to rely on Draft for writing my blog posts. It&#8217;s simply the best writing tool out there that I can use with my <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/cool-thing-thursday-a-300-euro-keyboard/swizec/5690\">fancy keyboard</a> (linux, no iA Writer, bad wrists).</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m not here today to talk about the marvelous version control features, the fact I can click the equivalent of &#8220;Save back to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"WordPress\" href=\"http://wordpress.org\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress</a>&#8221; when I&#8217;m done writing, or even the &#8220;Get feedback from an expert&#8221; feature.</p>\n<p>No, today I want to tell you about the brilliant trick Nathan Kontny used to convert me from a freeloader to the proud owner of a $4 monthly subscription.</p>\n<p>I login one day, right from the WordPress dashboard (Chrome extension), and what do I see if not a big pop up sort of thing saying &#8220;Hey, you should totally subscribe!&#8221;. As a geek and a nerd I find these things tacky, overdone, and rather pushy.</p>\n<p>But this was different. There was no blackout, no flashing colours, just a friendly message from the founder saying &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m making this thing and I need your help to keep it awesome.&#8221;. More importantly, <em>he started a conversation</em>!</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/c89bJzgRlerjCMR6C1ME\" alt=\"Draft asks me to sign up\" width=\"606\" height=\"431\" />\n<p>Sidenote: Wow, I was just delighted by how easy inserting an image is. Shift+Ctrl+I, drag image into browser. Beautiful.</p>\n<p><em>khem</em></p>\n<p>See, it&#8217;s not a pushy sales thing, it&#8217;s an honest ask. If you don&#8217;t want to, that&#8217;s fine too, but please tell me why.</p>\n<p>I was instantly convinced.</p>\n<p>Left a message saying how awesome I find the service and <em>how infinitely brilliant is the fact I can reply to a &#8220;please subscribe message&#8221;</em>. Later that day I kept my promise and subscribed.</p>\n<p>Better still, later that day I got a reply.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/agNbhVprQoSZAjZaeIau\" alt=\"Draft replies\" width=\"538\" height=\"394\" />\n<p>You have no idea how delighted I am by this little exchange. And now I&#8217;m spending $4 a month on something I use maybe twice a week for maybe an hour to indulge in what is a glorified hobby.</p>\n<p>In comparison, I pay $5 a month for <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Toggl.com\" href=\"http://www.toggl.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Toggl</a> &#8211; the basis of thousands of dollars worth of invoices, I use <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"GitHub\" href=\"http://github.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Github</a> daily and don&#8217;t pay a dime &#8230; actually I don&#8217;t pay for most things I spend my whole days on.</p>\n<p>Good job Draft, you&#8217;re doing something right. This is probably the biggest bang for buck a service has ever gotten out of me.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=5f8cc117-11b3-4973-8d8d-8481e1aec05b\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"91a46f8d-2a5c-5026-ab31-0fbeefd10da7"}}
