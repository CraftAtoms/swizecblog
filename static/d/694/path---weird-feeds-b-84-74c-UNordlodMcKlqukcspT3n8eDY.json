This isn&#8217;t a real post, just a quick note to all of you who have been complaining about repeated posts.</p>\n<p>Over the past week or so I moved my feed over to feedburner. While doing that things went wrong and I spammed all of you with a few tens of repeated posts.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p>Then two days ago I finally figured out how to convince feedburner to use a full feed instead of excerpts. This lead to more spamming and I&#8217;m told some people are now receiving each post twice.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one of the people having issues, I suggest you replace your subscriptions with this link:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/AGeekWithAHat2\">http://feeds.feedburner.com/AGeekWithAHat2</a></p>\n<p>That is the direct real feed now so hopefully there won&#8217;t be any problems ðŸ™‚</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d3d3bab9-b81c-4c55-9315-290b360817ad\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"11e62bf3-f9ee-51c5-a04c-7f02451f1b4f"}}
