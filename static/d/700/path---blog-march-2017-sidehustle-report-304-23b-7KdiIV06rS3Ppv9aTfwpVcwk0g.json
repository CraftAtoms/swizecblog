That&#39;s just $200 short of my post-tax day job income. ?</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is not a trend. There were bumps, and I already know April is going to be slow. Unless a few Hail Marys come through‚Ä¶ you don&#39;t wanna rely on Hail Marys when rent is due, though. üòÄ</p>\n<p>Here&#39;s why that revenue can&#39;t pay rent (yet):</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7539\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gumroad-screenshot.png\" width=\"1031\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gumroad-screenshot.png 1031w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gumroad-screenshot-300x148.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gumroad-screenshot-768x380.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gumroad-screenshot-1024x507.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1031px) 100vw, 1031px\" />\n<p>Such stable sales LOL</p>\n<p><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $5874</p>\n<p><strong>Gumroad sales:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>React + D3v4 preorders: $381 &#8211; fees</li>\n<li>ES6 Cheatsheet: $50 &#8211; fees</li>\n<li>React + D3 ES6: $886 &#8211; fees</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Leanpub sales:</strong> $249</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why Programmers Work at Night: $8</li>\n<li>React + D3 ES6: $92</li>\n<li>React + D3v4: $149</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Packt royalties:</strong> $514</p>\n<p><strong>React Native School:</strong> $1464</p>\n<p><strong>In-Person Workshops:</strong> $1819</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ForwardJS: $256</li>\n<li>Self-organized: $1534</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 96 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Cost:</strong> $2277</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More camera gear: $279</li>\n<li>Editor: $575</li>\n<li>VA: $337</li>\n<li>Apple Developer Account: $107</li>\n<li>reactd3js.com domain: $10</li>\n<li>AppSumo: $99</li>\n<li>Drip: $184</li>\n<li>Hosting: $10</li>\n<li>LiveEdu account: $10</li>\n<li>Ads (Facebook + Twitter): $256</li>\n<li>Lunch for workshop peeps: $60</li>\n<li>Workshop space: $350</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Net hourly rate:</strong> $37 pre-tax</p>\n<p>That&#39;s $5 more than last month! ?? I&#39;ve arrived!</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.giphy.com/ZPFQVis9WAAcE.gif\" />\n<p>You might not notice this, but there are plenty of business failings in those numbers. The new React+D3v4 edition is better priced, a better product, <em>and</em> people who read it rave about how great it is.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s making low sales because 1) I&#39;m not advertising it and 2) if you don&#39;t know it exists, you&#39;ll never find it. None of my websites, not even the book&#39;s landing page, link to it. There isn&#39;t even a buy button unless you send me an email and say, <em>&quot;Yo dude, your book looks outdated&quot;</em>. Then I send you an email like <em>&quot;Yes, here&#39;s the new one.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>This is terrible, and I should feel bad. (hint: I do)</p>\n<p>Yes, I should <em>just</em> fix it. As time passes, emotional baggage builds around that &quot;just&quot;. The book is not done yet, I&#39;m gonna feel even more pressures once I switch the buy buttons, the landing page copy needs to be redone, the page itself needs redoing, I have to set up ads, there are emails to send, even more existing customers need to be sent their free upgrade, there&#39;s more and more of them every week that I don&#39;t change the landing page and just so many different things‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Why can&#39;t I just build cool shit and let all that other stuff care for itself?</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, &#39;cause I haven&#39;t hired anyone to handle that. Because I&#39;m too swamped to spend time finding people to help me.</p>\n<p>Nice spiral of doom, that one. Working <em>on</em> the business versus working <em>in</em> the business. ?</p>\n<p>And <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/boutique-react-d3v4-workshop/swizec/7519\">the workshop‚Ä¶ that was great</a>. Magnificent. People loved it. We sold 6 tickets out of the 12 tickets we had. Don&#39;t start marketing stuff like that two weeks before it happens. Lesson learned.</p>\n<p>The Chicago workshop in May is going to do even better.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ab22fb0c-756d-586e-a79a-97857dc5a94c"}}
