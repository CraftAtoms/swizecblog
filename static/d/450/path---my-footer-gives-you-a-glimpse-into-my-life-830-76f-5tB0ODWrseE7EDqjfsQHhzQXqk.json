{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"My new footer gives you a glimpse into my life","content":"<p>Over the past week and a half my life has been devoted mostly to studying for exams and absolutely killing the slaughterhouse my university calls &#8220;Making sure people learn shit&#8221;. As a result my coding fingers have been pretty itchy, but I didn&#8217;t have enough brainpower left to do anything serious.</p>\n<p>So I decided to spend some of my study breaks doing some housekeeping around the site. This resulted in a pretty awesome super informative footer that has already produced some fine results as far as visitor behaviour goes.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 789px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/g9XOu4.jpg\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Super informative footer\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/g9XOu4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"779\" height=\"488\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Super informative footer</p></div>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s pretty big as far as footers go, but I wanted something that&#8217;s very airy and looks nice. If it doesn&#8217;t look like the picture for you, please let me know so I can fix it.</p>\n<p>The point of this footer is that it isn&#8217;t just some static &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m this guy and I do this stuff, follow me on twitter, be my friend, I&#8217;m awesome&#8221;. No. The only static parts of this monster are the section titles and a sentence or two. Everything else is dynamically updated from the various social and data tracking services I use.</p>\n<p>My current location is pulled directly from <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Foursquare\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.foursquare.com/\">Foursquare,</a> the last few photos are from Instagram, the latest stuff I&#8217;m working on is just a list of repositories I last pushed to on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"GitHub\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://github.com\">Github</a>. The part about what I&#8217;m listening to is a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Last.fm Widget\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/widgets/\">last.fm widget</a> and that awesome thing telling you that I only have about 19k more days to live is a pretty brilliant new site I randomly found &#8230; going to blog about that later this week, because it&#8217;s just super awesome.</p>\n<p>Another important bit is the navigation linking visitors to the previous and next post. Now I dont&#8217; have any metrics yet, but ever since I added those two links activity surrounding my old posts has shot up infinitely. I say infinitely because there didn&#8217;t used to be any. People probably thought there was only ever one post on the whole blog ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Originally the idea for this footer came from <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Buster Benson\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://busterbenson.com/\">Buster Benson</a>&#8216;s home page. He&#8217;s the guy who made <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"750 Words\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://750words.com\">750words.com</a> and it seems like his home page is pulling data from some of the things he writes on and making real-time analysis of how he&#8217;s feeling. I wanted to have something like that, but didn&#8217;t feel like devoting my whole site to it.</p>\n<p>The answer came when I stumbled upon <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Dustin Curtis\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://dustincurtis.com/\">Dustin Curtis</a>&#8216; home page. Everything is just brilliantly styled there, but when I saw how his footer works, I was in love. Suddenly I knew exactly where to put the data about my life and I knew almost exactly what I wanted it to look like.</p>\n<p>So thanks to @dcurtis and @busterbenson, you probably won&#8217;t read this, but thanks for the inspiration anyway.</p>\n<p>Also, if you have any suggestions about what I could add to the footer, do tell. I was thinking about adding a counter for the amount of tasks I&#8217;ve completed lately (<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Toggl.com\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.toggl.com\">Toggl</a> has an API), or displaying some of my latest tweets &#8230; perhaps the ones that get retweeted so it isn&#8217;t too horrible to read.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/750-words-a-day-keeps-the-insanity-away/swizec/1703\">750 words a day keeps the insanity away</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blogs.sitepoint.com/2009/12/10/ten-fat-footers-web-design/\">Ten Fat Footers: How to Make Good Use of that Space at the End of the Page</a> (blogs.sitepoint.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.bloggingot.com/blogging-tips/3-powerful-website-toolbars-for-bloggers/\">3 Powerful Website Toolbars for Bloggers</a> (bloggingot.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.clickfire.com/my-blog-guest/\">My Blog Guest &#8211; Hype or Monstrous Backlink Machine?</a> (clickfire.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=24117611-b98a-4a71-8c6a-09648c5d7f0b\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c830ea2d-b45d-5421-be2a-ecf566fa68b1"}}
