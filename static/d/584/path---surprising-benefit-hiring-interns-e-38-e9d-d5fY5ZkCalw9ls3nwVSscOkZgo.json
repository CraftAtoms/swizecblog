{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"The surprising benefit of hiring interns to write your code","content":"<p>As you may know, I recently <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/hire-these-interns/swizec/8500\">hired some interns</a>.</p>\n<p>Two interns because I couldn&#8217;t decide which one I like more. Said I&#8217;d decide in two weeks. It&#8217;s been two weeks.</p>\n<p>My mental state before hiring looked like this 👇</p>\n<img src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-m06IHIKx56Q/Upvh284PRiI/AAAAAAAAGcg/Dki558dQ1O4/s640/PM+Scare+2.png\" alt=\"Wait But Why's Panic Monster\" />\n<blockquote><p>\nAaaaaaaa I have so many ideas aaaaaa I have to make content aaaaaa I don&#8217;t have time for all this aaaaaaaa this code does not excite me aaaaaaaa\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>You know, the whole spiel of “I have too much work, I can&#8217;t handle all of this, so I&#8217;m going to avoid doing any of it instead.” Then you feel even worse about it and it&#8217;s even harder to do any of the work. Time goes on, panic grows, you are not happy.</p>\n<p>So I hired two interns.</p>\n<p>Now my mood is more like this 👇</p>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/26xBENWdka2DSvvag/giphy.gif\" />\n<p>Feels like a superpower, my friend.</p>\n<p>I am calmer. I am more focused. I am less panicked. I am still behind on content.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll get to why I&#8217;m behind on content in a bit. 😅</p>\n<h2>Benefit 1: Don&#8217;t keep it in the brain</h2>\n<p>When you hire people, you can&#8217;t say <em>&#8220;Okay, these ideas in my brain 👉 build them&#8221;</em>. You have to transfer those ideas into their brain first.</p>\n<p>You might realize there aren&#8217;t as many as you thought.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That moment when you write out all the ideas you&#39;ve been stressing about not having time to build for 6 months and you realize there&#39;s only 16</p>\n<p>I&#39;m dumb <a href=\"https://t.co/QbKGBKjttx\">pic.twitter.com/QbKGBKjttx</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/1013595847022374913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 2, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>16… 16 ideas were keeping me up at night, stressing me out, and generally making me miserable for <em>months</em>. Why? Because they were all bouncing around in my head, attracting more ideas, and snowballing into a big scary monster that I just didn&#8217;t want to deal with.</p>\n<p>Did you know my blog that gets the most traffic of any site I own <em>and</em> it directly ties into my books, but it still doesn&#8217;t link to the books it&#8217;s trying to sell? It&#8217;s been 3 years. Come on, man.</p>\n<p>Writing out all of those ideas, even just as 3 word Trello cards, relieved an immense amount of pressure. The stress fell off my shoulders like it was never even there.</p>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/YA6dmVW0gfIw8/giphy.gif\" />\n<p>The difference is night and day. Even my dayjob.exe boss said I look more focused, get more and better work done, and have become an all &#8217;round better person.</p>\n<p>Offloading your worries, this shit works. Which leads us to 👇</p>\n<h2>Benefit 2: Stuff happens when you&#8217;re not looking</h2>\n<p>People taking care of the things you don&#8217;t wanna take care of: it&#8217;s like a superpower. You say, <em>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if so and so were true about my website or app?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>And in a day or two, it&#8217;s true. Like magic. You didn&#8217;t have to do anything. You don&#8217;t even have to be super specific about what it is that you want. 🤨</p>\n<p>Many people go overboard with micromanaging and pixel perfection and stuff like that. None of it matters at my stage. I just want the features to be there. We can fix it later.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHey, we need a way to navigate back and forth between lessons on learnwhileyoupoop.com. Can you figure it out?\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Two days later, you get a PR: &#8220;Navigation buttons on each lesson&#8221;</p>\n<p>You try it out. See that it works. Give some feedback on the code, maybe some recommendations. Tweak a few minor details yourself.</p>\n<p>That evening, your site has new buttons and it&#8217;s easier to use 🎉</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8518\" style=\"width: 2138px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8518\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screenshot.png\" alt=\"Navigation on learnwhileyoupoop.com\" width=\"2128\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screenshot.png 2128w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screenshot-300x37.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screenshot-768x95.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screenshot-1024x126.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2128px) 100vw, 2128px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Navigation on learnwhileyoupoop.com</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that I <em>couldn&#8217;t</em> build those buttons myself. It wouldn&#8217;t even take very long. It&#8217;s that I have higher leverage things to worry about.</p>\n<a href=\"https://medium.com/@swizec/do-more-work-less-993867826355\"><img src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT-1024x1022.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8521\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT-1024x1022.png 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT-150x150.png 150w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT-300x300.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT-768x767.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT-125x125.png 125w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/0_gDit71HzP-KJ9JJT.png 1202w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a>\n<p>\nwhich brings us to 👇</p>\n<h2>Benefit 3: High level programming 🤘</h2>\n<p>Last year, I experimented with building an AI that writes JavaScript. It didn&#8217;t work, but the idea went something like:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nWhat if you could write code as if you were a product manager, not a programmer? You could just say what you want, give it a rough description, and the machine would figure out the details.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>When you&#8217;re a product manager, the machine figuring out the details is a human or a team of humans, sometimes entire companies. At the CEO level of a big company, you say <strong>Make It So</strong> and it happens. Eventually.</p>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/bKnEnd65zqxfq/giphy.gif\" />\n<p>Same effect happens at every level.</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHey intern dude, I would like for the fonts on learnwhileyoupoop.com to not be broken\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Sounds easy, right? Swizec, come on man, you can fix some fonts. You&#8217;re a goddamn full-stack engineer!</p>\n<p>It was very tricky. Something about CSS file loads being in the wrong order and Webpack not letting you configure it super well and then a font definition overrides another definition and the browser silently drops the font and never even loads…</p>\n<p>🤯</p>\n<p>Took my intern a whole day to fix. You know when I&#8217;d find a full day to tinker with something like that? Never.</p>\n<p>Next week, he&#8217;s writing a blog about it, too ✌️</p>\n<h2>I am become delegation man</h2>\n<p>Well, not really, I&#8217;m learning. But it sounds cool, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n<img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/3oEjHH2CAgweWX4qnS/giphy.gif\" />\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b334c3a1-286e-53e8-8945-462a667352bf"}}
