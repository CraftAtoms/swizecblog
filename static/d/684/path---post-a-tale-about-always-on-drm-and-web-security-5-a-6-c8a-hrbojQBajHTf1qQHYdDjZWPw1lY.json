She shows me minecraft, I show her Diablo. Everyone&#8217;s happy.</p>\n<p>But nope.</p>\n<p>I run Diablo, I mash in my password because of <em>course</em> you have to log in to play a game with yourself. What could possibly be more natural &#8230; but okay, maybe I don&#8217;t want my cat to mess with my characters and Blizzard doesn&#8217;t want me stealing their game. Fair enough.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Oh hai thar! We noticed some suspicious activity on your account so we decided you have to verify you&#8217;re you via <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Battle.net\" href=\"http://www.battle.net/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Battle.net</a>. Here&#8217;s a link to get you going&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Really? All I did was try to login from a different IP. I&#8217;m at a friend&#8217;s place damn it, this is a laptop, what if I wanted to play in a coffee shop or on a plane or a pterodactyl?</p>\n<p>Sigh, fine &#8230; I click the link expecting I&#8217;ll just have to login on Battle.net so they can confirm I also know how to login with a browser and supposedly am not hacking.</p>\n<p>Tap tap tap.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;So, you want to give us some digits of a physical copy of a game even though the only game associated with your account is a digital-only copy of Diablo? Or do you want to try answering your <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Knowledge-based authentication\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_authentication\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">secret question</a>?&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well crap, this isn&#8217;t just about logging in. I have just been forced to reset my password via a security question <em>just because I tried to play a game at a friend&#8217;s place!</em></p>\n<p>I try once. I try twice. I try three times. Nothing.</p>\n<p>This can happen when you choose random <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Security question\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_question\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">security questions</a> and don&#8217;t always answer truthfully because, you know, social engineering. Usually I just mash my hand over the keyboard.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;You have made too many attempts! Your account is now locked! Contact support.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh okay! Right. I&#8217;m using the wrong account! I used <em>swizec@swizec.com</em> for the Diablo3 beta, then was unable to recover it when I wanted the full game. The real account is <em>swizec+battle@swizec.com</em></p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s try again.</p>\n<p>A few attempts later &#8230; OH! The security question is different on this account. Fuck me.</p>\n<p>Yay, I&#8217;m in!</p>\n<p>After two round-trips via email, countless attempts at answering the security question, numerous fiddles with the password to get them all matching and fitting the security rules I am finally in.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. No <em>Hey thanks</em>, no, <em>You can go game now</em>, just a cold account dashboard.</p>\n<p>Close tab. Run game. Log in.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Your password is incorrect&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Oh for fuck&#8217;s sake! I mistyped my password &#8230; twice &#8230; consistently enough that they matched.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6093\" style=\"width: 730px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diablo-massacre.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-6093 \" title=\"Diablo massacre\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diablo-massacre.png\" alt=\"Diablo massacre\" width=\"720\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diablo-massacre.png 800w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/diablo-massacre-300x187.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Diablo massacre</p></div>\n<p>Sigh, now how do I change my password?</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Okay, just give us your old password and you can change it&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>But I don&#8217;t know the old password!</p>\n<p>Log out. Reset password. <em>&#8220;You have made too many attempts! Your account is locked! Contact support.</em><em>&#8220;</em></p>\n<p>Oh fuck me. Fine. I will contact support because this is getting silly and I am fed up with you mr. Battle.net!</p>\n<p>Clicky clicky through tens of questions trying to divert me from contacting a real person and making me solve my own problems. I battle it through like a champ and finally reach three options: Submit ticket, live chat, phone call.</p>\n<p>Live chat and phone call are currently offline. Well okay, it <em>is</em> midnight and you are the European Blizzard support people so you&#8217;re probably sleeping. Fine.</p>\n<p>I click Submit ticket.</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Please login to your Battle.net account to submit tickets&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p><em></em>ARGH!</p>\n<p>I threw the computer out the window and cried myself to sleep.</p>\n<p>Ok, in reality I carefully put the computer away after slamming it shut ever so gently, it&#8217;s new you know, and watched a movie or something with my friend. Screw Diablo.</p>\n<p>Next day I got home and unlocked my account without a fuss. No hint of too many attempts, no complaints about suspicious activity. Nothing. Just worked.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m confused. Yesterday my account was hacked and Terrible Things &#8482; were going on, today everything is fine and you don&#8217;t even warn me that a crazy amount of stupid was happening last night? Right &#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=7e879824-058e-4579-a7d6-f7aa6c103042\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2ff00cc1-1774-5ffb-aa6f-f908bea7ee03"}}
