I launched a product in 3 days and when I woke up on Tuesday there were four <em>&#8220;Notification of payment received&#8221;</em> emails in my inbox.</p>\n<p>The idea behind <a href=\"http://postme.me\">postme.me</a> is pretty simple &#8211; postcards are cool! Let&#8217;s have a service to send cool postcards all over the world for cheap.</p>\n<p>Actually the idea didn&#8217;t pop up 3 days before launch. It was brewing for a while &#8230; the beginnings can be traced back to a silly evening at the DoubleRecall headquarters in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Palo Alto, California\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.4291666667,-122.138055556&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.4291666667,-122.138055556 (Palo%20Alto%2C%20California)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\">Palo Alto</a>. We were messing about and somebody said &#8220;Fuck man, you&#8217;re not making it better!&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Five minutes later I bought notmakingitbetter.com &#8230; we raced even, I clicked the fastest.</p>\n<p>The following day I started thinking about what I could possibly do with this domain. Heading for a night of partying in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"San Francisco\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7793,-122.4192&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.7793,-122.4192 (San%20Francisco)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\">San Francisco</a> that evening, an idea to send &#8220;4chan cookies&#8221; to people popped up. Basically, you choose something from 4chan, we put it in a fortune cookie and send it anywhere.</p>\n<p>And that was that. My mind went and got occupied by other things.</p>\n<p>Until two weeks ago when I was going through a notebook and saw the idea jotted down &#8211; always carry a notebook guys ðŸ˜‰ &#8211; surprisingly I still liked it. It got through the first test of worthiness!</p>\n<p>But <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Fortune cookie\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_cookie\" rel=\"wikipedia\">fortune cookies</a>? That&#8217;s not really viable, how the hell do you make those? Are there people who provide them? Would I bake them in my mum&#8217;s kitchen?</p>\n<p>A few evenings later it clicked &#8211; POSTCARDS! Postcards are perfect for sending silly pictures to friends!</p>\n<p>I had no idea how postcards are made, but it seemed viable. Asked a designer friend if he can recommend a print shop &#8211; he recommended two. Sent out emails and one of the shops was kind enough to provide a price estimate without my knowing what the fuck it is that I even want.</p>\n<p>Next day I checked the local post office&#8217;s prices and set the price of sending a postcard at $2. It&#8217;s cheap enough for people to click without thinking much about it, and it covers my costs plus enough overhead to cover anything I didn&#8217;t think of.</p>\n<p>That evening I forced myself to bed.</p>\n<p>Next morning I woke up and about 25 hours of coding and designing later, the website was born.</p>\n<p>Posted it to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hacker News\" href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">HackerNews</a> and collapsed into bed.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s just an experiment. The site sucks. No point investing too much effort, if people won&#8217;t click the magic button&#8221;, </em>I kept telling myself. But really I was excited out of my mind. This was the first time in my life I wasn&#8217;t giving a product away for free. This was edgy balls to the wall stuff for me &#8211; asking people for <em>money? On the internet!?</em>Â Madness!</p>\n<p>Next morning the website was full of naked pictures. But I did make some sales!</p>\n<p>Sweet!</p>\n<p>A couple of days later I convinced the print shop to let me do ultra small runs of prints. As little as 9 at a time, at almost the same price per card as doing 200. The post office also didn&#8217;t bat an eyelid at my interesting postcards and dutifully sent them on their way.</p>\n<p>Two weeks since the idea originally crystalized in my head, the site still hasn&#8217;t made enough sales for a full print run. But it has made enough sales to cover the costs of that first print of 9 cards. Even though most were sent to random people from <a title=\"I learned two things today 21.8.\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-21-8/swizec/2275\">my postcard escapade back in August</a>.</p>\n<p>The great thing about this whole project is that I know exactly where to fish for people. I know perfectly which sites I need to advertise on to reach my target customers and I know that even though there are many postcard services around, none seems to be targeting this niche for some reason.</p>\n<p>The only problem I have is that I can&#8217;t afford the advertising.</p>\n<p>But projects without problems are boring.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ask.metafilter.com/198794/Fourcolor-postcards\">Four-color postcards?</a> (ask.metafilter.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-send-real-postcard-phone-postcard-run/\">Create &amp; Send A Real Postcard With Your Phone Using Postcard On The Run</a> (makeuseof.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.pixiq.com/article/from-pixels-to-postcards\">From Pixels to Postcards</a> (pixiq.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://kenleydarling.wordpress.com/2011/10/18/postagram-has-change-my-life-and-my-blog/\">Postagram has change my life! &#8230;and my blog.</a> (kenleydarling.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://printsunnysideup.wordpress.com/2011/10/13/postcards-a-thing-of-the-past-not-likely/\">Postcards: A Thing of the Past &#8211; Not Likely</a> (printsunnysideup.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=e085b346-1171-4cf6-b176-82d9b31a998e\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9e9c0adf-97a7-5bb9-ab3b-f20135bc2903"}}
