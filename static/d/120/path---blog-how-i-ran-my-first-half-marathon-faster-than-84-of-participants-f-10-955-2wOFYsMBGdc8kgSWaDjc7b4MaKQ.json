Half of the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"San Francisco Marathon\" href=\"http://www.thesfmarathon.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">San Francisco Marathon</a> this Sunday.</p>\n<p>I ran the 2nd half of the full marathon. Started at 8:17am at the far end of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Golden Gate Park\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7697222222,-122.476944444&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=37.7697222222,-122.476944444 (Golden%20Gate%20Park)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Golden Gate Park</a>, near some sort of lake, and finished by the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"San Francisco Ferry Building\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7955555556,-122.392222222&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=37.7955555556,-122.392222222 (San%20Francisco%20Ferry%20Building)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Ferry Building</a> at 10:07am. An hour and fifty minutes later. And twelve seconds.</p>\n<p>1:50:12</p>\n<p>Ten minutes faster than my best training run. Faster than 84% of everybody else that day. Faster than 67% of people in my age group.</p>\n<p>But only within 52% of what a guy my age could achieve in theory. That&#8217;s because the world record for a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Half marathon\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_marathon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">half marathon</a> is just 57 minutes and I am nowhere near an elite runner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-run\">The run</h2>\n<p>Running my first half marathon was as joyful as it was magical. I frolicked and the birds sang and sparrows flew and my mind was clear and the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Endorphins\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">runner&#8217;s high</a> was high and the endorphins were pumping and a big fat grin covered my face.</p>\n<p>Ha, I wish.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"This is how much I enjoyed myself\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/31140?token=EZpKwxBM_OMxbUG2o0Og3aJ9af_LNYfFdJhI7eWwIERKysD2OJCtx-Sfu-xaHime5E92LeUVStn1IkeFEfJdBR0\" alt=\"This is how much I enjoyed myself\" width=\"640\" height=\"960\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is how much I enjoyed myself</p></div>\n<p>It was miserable. Running is miserable. Everything about running is miserable. Anyone who says otherwise is either lying or fooling themselves. Or they&#8217;re one of those people who run in full makeup and never break a sweat and smile for pictures.</p>\n<p>I hate those people.</p>\n<p>Running <em>sucks</em>. You have to get up early, you&#8217;re cold, you&#8217;re bored out of your mind, your legs hurt, your feet hurt, your lungs hurt, your abs hurt, and you know exactly how Spotify&#8217;s random function works.</p>\n<p>And you&#8217;re cold and you&#8217;re hot and you&#8217;re dehydrated and you want to watch the world burn and everything sucks.</p>\n<p>And to top it off, it burns all your gym gainz away so you have to work double hard just to keep up.</p>\n<p>BUT!</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s the best way in the world to get alone time. And it gives you time to think. And it forces you to think. And when you&#8217;re done you&#8217;re <em>so happy</em> that you don&#8217;t have to keep going.</p>\n<p>You know that feeling where you&#8217;re suffering and you&#8217;re suffering and everything is shit until suddenly it isn&#8217;t shit anymore? When you&#8217;re doing like the hardest thing ever and then you&#8217;re done and it&#8217;s like the world is a new place?</p>\n<p>Running is like that. The best part is when you get to stop.</p>\n<p>At least that&#8217;s what running to train is like. Running to race is &#8230; hard.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve just spent a few days resting because you&#8217;re not an idiot. You can train when your legs are sore, but you can&#8217;t race with sore legs. You have to be rested.</p>\n<p>And because you&#8217;re rested, you run fast. Faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>And because there&#8217;s people around you, you run even faster. Faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>And because you&#8217;re about to crap out and die, because you&#8217;re running faster than ever before. You run faster still so it would be over quicker. Faster than ever before.</p>\n<p>My normal long run pace is 5:11/km. But I stop at stoplights and such, so the pace ends up slower &#8211; around 5:40/km.</p>\n<p>My race running pace was 4:50/km. But I crapped out and had to walk. So the pace became 5:14/km.</p>\n<p>Eesh.</p>\n<p>At the finish line, there was no joy, no elation, no endorphin rush. There was just pain, breathing, and cold.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-result\">The result</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 714px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"\" title=\"This is my official result\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/31056?token=e2pLpQeoUjckozYnCfyhOs9zQR1eO3aEwezsHLDEDmZgefRvs5D0wt9qF4GVmjitX2Ktw2Sj3SgVlBR77q7Gwvk\" alt=\"This is my official result\" width=\"704\" height=\"406\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is my official result</p></div>\n<p>There you have it, my new personal best for a half marathon across San Francisco hills.</p>\n<p>In the top 16% overall, top 25% for men, and top 33% for men my age. It <em>feels</em> like a good result. It&#8217;s a huge improvement over my training runs. But it bugs me that it&#8217;s not a top result. You know?</p>\n<p>Age is still working for me, not against me. Especially in running. I&#8217;ve got the mental fortitude to do these stupid things, while still having the physical advantages of youth.</p>\n<p>Even the data says so. For my age, results skew towards faster runs.</p>\n<img class=\"\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/31141?token=zd_-0CWzVH_1UBR-chTKtNmGDqOJ81x2wZ6crwloYrRUwU5_34VK7yACpaHvyLVZbZp3E607vEUpQypkk8ZmTI0\" alt=\"27 year olds skew towards faster runs\" width=\"705\" height=\"263\" />\n<p>Which means that even though I&#8217;m in the top third of my age group, my result falls exactly where most results cluster.</p>\n<p>This implies two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can achieve this result with modest training</li>\n<li>Achieving a better result is <em>hard</em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Five people my age achieved a result in the 1:50:xx range. The next worst is 1:52:xx with 3 people. The next best, 1:49:xx, has 7 people. But 1:48:xx has only 1. And 1:47:xx has only 3.</p>\n<p>After that, there are at most 2 people per minute, with most results being several minutes apart.</p>\n<p>This indicates that something breaks around 1:50:xx. I don&#8217;t know <em>what</em> breaks, but the data indicates that only those who are really good can go much faster than 1:50:xx.</p>\n<p>Maybe this is the point of diminishing returns for half marathon training.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-training\">The training</h2>\n<p>My training philosophy is simple &#8211; run a lot.</p>\n<p>I started running regularly in April 2014 because a lull in boxing activity left me with too much energy and I couldn&#8217;t sleep. So I ran every day. For four kilometers.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 712px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Training log pt1\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/31142?token=MATXX3iXPzLzqjN7VuiI8fv5wL2yAr2Rlxz2IRoVTjBLlHtDPi5Av49VlCCvONlGFgS7WPEyw251zr2H50JwBr4\" alt=\"Training log pt1\" width=\"702\" height=\"586\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Training log pt1</p></div>\n<p>And that was that. I ran. When I started it took me almost 24 minutes to run four kilometers, and a whopping 54 minutes to run nine kilometers.</p>\n<p>A 10k was far out and I would have died.</p>\n<p>The first time I did run a 10k &#8211; in June 2014, it took me 1 hour and 2 minutes. At that pace, a half marathon would take 2 hours and 36 minutes. 46 minutes longer than it took on Sunday.</p>\n<p>But running had become a staple and I kept running my short weekday runs and my long Sunday runs. Six times a week at first, then four times, and in the end I settled at three runs per week.</p>\n<p>A short run of 8km on Wednesday and Friday, and a long run of 21km on Sunday.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right, for the past several months I have been running a half marathon every week. I figured if I&#8217;m training for a half marathon, I might as well run many half marathons.</p>\n<p>It worked because by race time, I was mentally prepared and I knew what it takes. Sure the quicker pace caught me a bit off guard, but I knew how to mentally keep myself going and I knew that I wouldn&#8217;t drop dead before the finish line.</p>\n<p>And because I had run many practice half marathons I knew how much I had to eat before the run, I knew that while I don&#8217;t <em>have to</em> drink during the run to make it through, my time is better if I do drink a bit. And I knew what hurts when you start and what hurts when you stop.</p>\n<p>Hint, it&#8217;s the butt and legs that protest the most in the beginning, and it&#8217;s your abs that are killing you when you&#8217;re done. I don&#8217;t know why.</p>\n<p>To make sure I knew how to run fast, some of my short runs would be fartleks. A 4km fast-paced run one way, then a 4km fast run interspersed with 500 meter sprints on the way back.</p>\n<p>Yes it kills you. Yes you need it anyway.</p>\n<p>And that was really it. I ran a lot and I made sure I was mentally prepared for what was coming.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-6707\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-00.37.39-1017x1024.png\" alt=\"Training log pt2\" width=\"692\" height=\"697\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-00.37.39-1017x1024.png 1017w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-00.37.39-150x150.png 150w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-00.37.39-298x300.png 298w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Screen-Shot-2015-07-31-at-00.37.39-125x125.png 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 692px) 100vw, 692px\" />\n<p>Well okay, I&#8217;ve been slacking lately &#8230;</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-stupid-idea\">The stupid idea</h2>\n<p>Now here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t count on: the full marathon I want to run is on October 25th.</p>\n<p>My longest run so far has been 23km. A marathon is 42km.</p>\n<p>Somehow I have to add 19 more kilometers to my longest run. And if nothing comes up I have 12 weekends to do it in.</p>\n<p>So from now on, I have to add 2km to my long run every weekend. This gives me one full marathon of practice before the race.</p>\n<p>And I want to run the race in under four hours.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna die.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"000ce21b-7219-57c5-81fe-c71b2fdc0768"}}
