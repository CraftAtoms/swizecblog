{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Tech intern job","content":"<p>Here&#8217;s the deal, I&#8217;m a solopreneur working nights and weekends on this <em>Turn programmers into engineers</em> business and I have more ideas than time. So I&#8217;m looking for an intern to help me out.</p>\n<p>Why an intern? Three reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s enough work for an experienced software engineer</li>\n<li>I think the tasks wouldn&#8217;t be challenging enough for an experienced engineer</li>\n<li>Cost; this is a small bootstrapped business</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What I&#8217;m offering</h2>\n<p>I can&#8217;t promise you piles of money and I can&#8217;t say you&#8217;re going to build software used by millions. Such is life üôÇ</p>\n<p>What I <em>can</em> offer is a paid learning opportunity.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll work remotely and part-time to implement various solutions big and small in JavaScript, React, and associated web technologies. We&#8217;ll start small and go bigger as time goes on.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t care where in the world you are, as long as your English is good enough that we can understand each other smoothly.</p>\n<p>When you hit a snag, I&#8217;m here to help. If you need to buy a book or a course to learn something, I will buy it for you.</p>\n<p>Think of this as a way to practice solving real problems. You are encouraged to leverage this experience into finding a real real job.</p>\n<h2>Your job</h2>\n<p>Your job will be to implement things I don&#8217;t have time for, so I can focus on producing content. This will involve:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>improvements to swizec.com</li>\n<li>building features for learnwhileyoupoop.com</li>\n<li>evaluating opensource libraries</li>\n<li>building example code</li>\n<li>build and improve landing pages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tech stack is a combination of React and WordPress. You&#8217;re encouraged to leverage existing solutions instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>\n<h2>How we&#8217;ll work together</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to communicate primarily through Slack. Video calls when necessary.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to have daily checkins and generally keep in touch while working together. You are encouraged to reach out to me whenever. </p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll be paid via PayPal or TransferWise every month based on an hourly rate we&#8217;ll figure out together. If neither PayPal nor TransferWise work for you, we can figure something out.</p>\n<h2>How we&#8217;ll find out if we&#8217;re a fit</h2>\n<p>For hiring, I&#8217;m prioritizing <a href=\"http://qr.ae/TUphry\">slope instead of y-intercept</a>. That is to say, I want you to be a fast learner not someone who already knows a lot.</p>\n<p>You should have basic knowledge of JavaScript, React, HTML, etc. I&#8217;ll give you the chance to learn the rest.</p>\n<p>The initial hiring process is going to go like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you&#8217;ve already reached out to me, probably üëçüèº (unless you&#8217;re reading this on my blog)</li>\n<li>after too long a wait, I replied (sorry üòÖ)</li>\n<li>you send me something you&#8217;ve made</li>\n<li><b>I teach you something</b></li>\n<li><b>you use the concept to build an example app</b></li>\n<li>I&#8217;ll use what you&#8217;ve built to gauge your slope</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My hope is that even if we don&#8217;t end up working together, you will still have learned something useful and built a little something you can add to your portfolio. That way I&#8217;m not wasting your time.</p>\n<h3>Next step</h3>\n<p>Our next step is a <strong>live webinar on June 13th at 9pm Pacific</strong> on <a href=\"https://youtube.com/SwizecTeller\">my YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t make it, don&#8217;t worry. The video will stay available forever, but I encourage you to come say hi and ask questions. This is your chance to evaluate me as well.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re going to cover an intermediate React concept or two.</p>\n<h2>‚úåÔ∏è</h2>\n<p>If all that sounds good, see you at the webinar. Hit reply, send me something you&#8217;ve built (school and book/course projects are perfect), and ask your questions üôÇ</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"eeca0882-4802-50cb-91dd-11a8f8705693"}}
