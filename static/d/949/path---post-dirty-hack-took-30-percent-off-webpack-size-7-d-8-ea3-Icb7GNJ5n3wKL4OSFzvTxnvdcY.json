Everything is minified and gzipped and cached forever. Fingerprinting ensures the code you download is never stale.</p>\n<p>Despite all that, hitting our corp site, you&#8217;re downloading 489KB of JavaScript. That&#8217;s one of our most optimized apps. The apps that people use to work with our product are worse. Some go up to 1MB of gzipped JavaScript. ðŸ˜…</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7652\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/big-files-screenshot.png\" width=\"1192\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/big-files-screenshot.png 1192w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/big-files-screenshot-300x167.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/big-files-screenshot-768x428.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/big-files-screenshot-1024x570.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1192px) 100vw, 1192px\" />\n<p>If you look at the <code>BundleAnalyzerPlugin</code> output of our Webpack build, you&#8217;ll see why.

Overall, JavaScript footprint is down by 53KB. Not bad for gzipped minified code.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at the unminified <code>BundleAnalyzerPlugin</code> output for our corp site.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7654\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-1.png\" width=\"1904\" height=\"1550\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-1.png 1904w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-1-300x244.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-1-768x625.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-1-1024x834.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1904px) 100vw, 1904px\" />\n<p>2.1 megs of unminified ungzipped code ðŸ˜…</p>\n<p>The first thing I did was to get rid of Moment&#8217;s locales following a suggestion in <a href=\"https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/2373\">this issue</a>. Moment is unfortunately not modularizable. They&#8217;ve been working on it for 2 years, so the best you can do is to use the <code>webpack.IgnorePlugin</code> to remove them from your build.</p>\n<p>Like this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\n// webpack.config.js\n\n// ...\n plugins: [\n        // ..\n        new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^\\.\\/locale$/, /moment$/)\n    ]\n</pre>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure <em>how</em> that works, but it removes most of what makes Moment big. We weren&#8217;t using locales anyway; all our string formatting used explicit format strings.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7655\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-2.png\" width=\"1878\" height=\"1540\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-2.png 1878w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-2-300x246.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-2-768x630.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-2-1024x840.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1878px) 100vw, 1878px\" />\n<p>That was easy.</p>\n<p>Smallifying Lodash, that made me feel cheeky. I ran a quick <code>git grep</code> to see how much of it we use. 32 functions. Out of well over 100 (200? More?) functions in the library.</p>\n<p>But J Dalton is amazing and publishes <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/lodash-modularized\">Lodash as a series of modules</a>. Each function has its own npm module.</p>\n<p>Armed with my <code>grep</code>, I set to work. The goal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>import only those Lodash modules that are used</li>\n<li><em>install</em> only those that are used</li>\n<li>avoid manually having to manage Lodash dependencies</li>\n<li>using <code>_.somethingLodash</code> should work without explicitly importing anything</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I came up with:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\n// webpack.config.js\n\nconst LodashModules = (() => {\n    const path = require('path'),\n          execSync = require('child_process').execSync;\n\n    const files = path.resolve(__dirname, './app/assets/javascripts'),\n          code = execSync(`grep -r \"_\\\\\\.\" ${files} --exclude=mathquill.js`,\n                          {encoding: 'utf-8'});\n\n\n    const matches = new Set(code.match(/_\\.([a-z]+)/ig));\n\n    return Array.from(matches.values())\n                .map(m => {\n                    let module = m.replace('_.', 'lodash.').toLowerCase(),\n                        vars = [m];\n\n                    if (module === 'lodash.extend') {\n                        module = 'lodash.assign';\n                        vars = vars.concat('_.assign');\n                    }\n                    if (module === 'lodash.each') {\n                        module = 'lodash.foreach';\n                        vars = vars.concat('_.forEach');\n                    }\n\n                    try {\n                        require.resolve(module);\n                    }catch(e) {\n                        console.log(`Installing ${module}`);\n                        execSync(`npm install --save ${module}`);\n                    }\n\n                    return new webpack.ProvidePlugin(\n                        _.fromPairs(vars.map(v => [v, module]))\n                    )\n                })\n})();\n\n// ...\n\n plugins: [\n        // ..\n        new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/^\\.\\/locale$/, /moment$/)\n    ].concat(LodashModules)\n</pre>\n<p>It&#8217;s dirty, cheeky, and beautifully insane. It might be brittle, but I found no signs of brokenness. It&#8217;s slow on first run and gets fast once all your modules are installed. Subsequent Webpack runs are just as fast as they&#8217;ve always been.</p>\n<p>And yes, you definitely should test your app thoroughly after using this. Very thoroughly.</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s similar to J Dalton&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash\">babel-plugin-lodash</a> in its core idea. To use only those parts of Lodash that you use.</p>\n<p>It differs in how this goal is achieved. Dalton&#8217;s plugin uses proper code analysis to find functions that are used and import them as <code>lodash/&lt;function&gt;</code> from a full install of Lodash.</p>\n<p>My solution goes for modular installation as well modular usage. If I&#8217;m not mistaken, this is easier for Webpack to optimize.</p>\n<p>And I think Dalton&#8217;s plugin needs you to explicitly import Lodash when you use it. Mine turns it into a magic super global via <code>webpack.ProvidePlugin</code>.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, when you say <code>_.map(stuff)</code>, my solution transforms that into <code>require('lodash.map')(stuff)</code>.</p>\n<p>Let me explain.</p>\n<h3>Find all occurrences of Lodash use</h3>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\nconst LodashModules = (() => {\n    const path = require('path'),\n          execSync = require('child_process').execSync;\n\n    const files = path.resolve(__dirname, './app/assets/javascripts'),\n          code = execSync(`grep -r \"_\\\\\\.\" ${files} --exclude=mathquill.js`,\n                          {encoding: 'utf-8'});\n\n\n    const matches = new Set(code.match(/_\\.([a-z]+)/ig));\n</pre>\n<p>We run a <code>grep -r \"_\\.\" &lt;files&gt;</code> search as a shell command. This returns all lines in all our files that use Lodash. I&#8217;m excluding <code>mathquill.js</code> in my case because it&#8217;s breaking convention and building its own old skool Lodash internally. Old library ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>With <code>grep</code> output in hand, we run a regex that extracts all occurrences of <code>_.something</code>. That means chaining doesn&#8217;t work. If you&#8217;re used to composing Lodash methods, you&#8217;re fine; if you&#8217;re not, you should get used to it.</p>\n<p><code>babel-lodash-plugin</code> also doesn&#8217;t understand chaining by the way.</p>\n<p>All occurrences of <code>_.something</code> are put in a <code>Set</code>. This removes any duplicates (of which there are many) and pares us down to 32 functions in my case.</p>\n<h3>Make magic imports</h3>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\n    return Array.from(matches.values())\n                .map(m => {\n                    let module = m.replace('_.', 'lodash.').toLowerCase(),\n                        vars = [m];\n\n                    if (module === 'lodash.extend') {\n                        module = 'lodash.assign';\n                        vars = vars.concat('_.assign');\n                    }\n                    if (module === 'lodash.each') {\n                        module = 'lodash.foreach';\n                        vars = vars.concat('_.forEach');\n                    }\n\n                    try {\n                        require.resolve(module);\n                    }catch(e) {\n                        console.log(`Installing ${module}`);\n                        execSync(`npm install --save ${module}`);\n                    }\n\n                    return new webpack.ProvidePlugin(\n                        _.fromPairs(vars.map(v => [v, module]))\n                    )\n                })\n})();\n</pre>\n<p>When we have those unique Lodash function calls, we walk through them, and for each one we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get a clean module name, <code>module.replace ...</code></li>\n<li>resolve aliases (the list is incomplete, it covers only what our codebase uses)</li>\n<li>try to import the module</li>\n<li>if it exists, move on</li>\n<li>if module doesn&#8217;t exist, install it and save to package.json</li>\n<li>create a new <code>ProvidePlugin</code> entry for the module</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting <code>ProvidePlugin</code> entries are added to the <code>plugins</code> array in our overall config.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7656\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-3.png\" width=\"1756\" height=\"1548\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-3.png 1756w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-3-300x264.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-3-768x677.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corp-screen-3-1024x903.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1756px) 100vw, 1756px\" />\n<p>And that&#8217;s how we removed 55KB of gzipped dependencies.
