{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"On the buying of new hair and other silly stuff","content":"<p>It&#8217;s not often that I go buy a new set of hair, actually I only do it once every two years or so. I don&#8217;t really mind going, in fact I kind of like the type of pampering my hair can only get at a <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/beauty_salon\" title=\"Beauty salon\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beauty_salon\">hair salon</a>. And the girls there are always so nice and chatty. It&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n<p>But I&#8217;m lazy.</p>\n<p>And I like longish hair. The good thing about <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/long_hair\" title=\"Long hair\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hair\">long hair</a> is that it just sort of happens on its own, you don&#8217;t have to really think too much. Once you get used to the mop it doesn&#8217;t even take that long to wash, certainly not as long as some girls will have you think to get out of a date they don&#8217;t want. Nope, nothing like having long hair. Who wants to be forced into going to the hairdresser&#8217;s once a month to keep their &#8216;do just the way they want it?</p>\n<p>Pffft.</p>\n<p>So anyway, today I went to CityPark because I wanted to try some new hair salon I&#8217;d never been to and the few times I passed this one it looked intriguing enough. Probably because of all the girls of Just The Right Age &#8482; working in there.</p>\n<p>First thing I did was step up to a random pillar and take a Before photo:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00443.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1438\" title=\"Before\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00443-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00443-300x225.jpg 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00443-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00443.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>If you look carefully you&#8217;ll see the hair was pretty long. It was actually about two centimeters beyond nipple-length. Definitely time to get a <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/hairstyle\" title=\"Hairstyle\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hairstyle\">haircut</a> because making a tail was getting annoying.</p>\n<p>The whole salon experience was pretty fun. The lass complained a lot about having to cut so much hair &#8230; apparently it&#8217;s a sin for people who want long hair but can&#8217;t get them to make long hair short &#8230; or something like that. There was also some complaining from the other girls about why they didn&#8217;t get to cut me &#8230; but since I don&#8217;t know what that was about I&#8217;ll just pretend they found me cute and wanted to touch my awesomeness ðŸ˜›</p>\n<p>Anyway, the hairdresser chick took the After photo and this is what my mop looks like now:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00445.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1439\" title=\"After\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00445-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00445-300x225.jpg 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00445-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/IMG00445.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a>I actually quite like it.
