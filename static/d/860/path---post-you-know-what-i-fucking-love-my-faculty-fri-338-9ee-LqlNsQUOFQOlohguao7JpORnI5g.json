And so they continue going until they get so fed up with everything and how disconnected their learnings are from the real world.</p>\n<p>Personally I must admit that until very recently I&#8217;ve always been one to conclude that university is my lovely redundancy plan and fuck it all, I&#8217;m just there for the student status and the shiny paper!</p>\n<p>And then something happened last week, or the week before, hard to say. I suddenly realised that this inclination of mine didn&#8217;t have <strong>anything</strong> to do with the university, faculty and classes themselves, but rather had <em>everything</em> to do with what I was wasting my time on.</p>\n<p>See, I was spending most of my days on semi-trivial algorithmical problems, most of what I was doing boiled down to coding-fu and how good a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Programmer\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer\">coder</a> I was. Yes, naturally, I thought of myself as a programmer and believed to be master of the universe, knower of all.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"display: block; width: 250px; margin: 1em; float: left;\">\n<div>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41864721@N00/4025513614/\"><img title=\"Autumn Aubusson\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2629/4025513614_8fc14e5bfb_m.jpg\" alt=\"Autumn Aubusson\" /></a></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd zemanta-img-attribution\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/41864721@N00/4025513614/\">ecstaticist</a> via Flickr</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>But apparently, the harder the problems you&#8217;re facing at work are, the more classes make sense and seem useful!
