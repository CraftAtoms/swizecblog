{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Music and The Zone","content":"<p>A lot has been said about The Zone &#8211; that magical place where doing something you love becomes instantly self-rewarding and you pull yourself along until you emerge on the other end. Slightly confused, a bit shaggy and you wonder why on earth are you hungry.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Beethoven.jpg\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Deutsch: Portrait Beethovens mit der Partitur ...\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/Beethoven.jpg/300px-Beethoven.jpg\" alt=\"Deutsch: Portrait Beethovens mit der Partitur ...\" width=\"300\" height=\"361\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>In fact, a couple of hours passed since you started working. You didn&#8217;t notice. The code is beyond any level you think yourself capable of achieving and when you try to understand how it works &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t really  make sense. But it works, passes all the tests, is beautiful and elegant. Feeding yourself might be a good idea as well.</p>\n<p>The Zone happened to me a lot more when I was younger. There&#8217;s something about being 12 years old and creating what you believe to be an operating system that destroys any and all distractions. They simply don&#8217;t exist. In those days a comet could have landed on my head and although dead, I wouldn&#8217;t have been distracted.</p>\n<p>Now I have the internet, a bunch of stuff on my mind and nobody to remind me I should eat and sleep &#8211; getting in The Zone is harder. And when I was little I thought two weeks of coding was a sprint, now anything more than a single night feels like a marathon &#8230; because I get more done, I think.</p>\n<p>For the past couple of months I&#8217;ve done a lot to figure out how I can get in The Zone better and I think music is a big part of it. Choosing just the perfect music for the perfect time is hard, but doable.</p>\n<p>Another important bit is that when I find it very very difficult to focus, I must go somewhere where there are a lot of distractions. Counter-intuitive, I know, but it works. I either blast three songs at once, or go to a coffee shop.</p>\n<p>Coffee shops are awesome. Something about everyone walking around, having conversations, music blasting out of the speakers and a nice cup of tea combined with a comfy chair really works wonders for my concentration. Maybe because my brain is so taxed that it simply has to focus just to function?</p>\n<p>The interesting bit is that my taste of music when coding changes a lot more than normally. It&#8217;s also very different from the music I usually listen to in that same day.</p>\n<p>Lately my favourite has been <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Wolfgang%2BAmadeus%2BMozart\" rel=\"lastfm\">Mozart</a> and, of all things, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Пётр Ильич Чайковский\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/%25D0%259F%25D1%2591%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%2B%25D0%2598%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%2B%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9\" rel=\"lastfm\">Tchaikovsky</a> &#8230; how the Nutcracker makes for good coding music is incomprehensible, but there you go, it does. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ludwig van Beethoven\" href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ludwig%2Bvan%2BBeethoven\" rel=\"lastfm\">Beethoven</a> is also a good choice, especially the more dramatic pumping symphonies.</p>\n<p>At other times I prefer something witha  bit more bass. Skrillex has worked particularly well for a while, then there&#8217;s a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tetris\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Tetris</a> remix playlist I made on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Spotify\" href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Spotify</a> that does wonders for my productivity. About a hundred versions of the same freaking song and it&#8217;s just awesome.</p>\n<p>All things considered, the only thing that really matters for getting in the zone is that my environment not be silent and distraction free. My brain simply can&#8217;t handle that &#8230;</p>\n<p>What kind of music do you listen to when working? Spotify gives me this unlimited jukebox, but I need to know what to look for.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//www10.nytimes.com/2011/11/24/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-with-jeffrey-kahane-review.html%3F_r%3D5&amp;a=63778269&amp;rid=2c25175d-98f5-474c-bd1b-1c285ad79c0a&amp;e=0c912b022057ed62cf99f3bcfdd4e73b\">Music Review: New York Philharmonic With Jeffrey Kahane &#8211; Review</a> (nytimes.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.ziggytek.com/2011/10/25/facebooks-music-partners-spotifyrdiomog-hit-music-html-code/\">Facebook&#8217;s Music Partners Spotify, Rdio, Mog hit Music HTML Code</a> (ziggytek.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://solitaryhorizons.com/2011/11/28/spotify-playlists-reliving-my-past/\">Spotify Playlists: Reliving My Past</a> (solitaryhorizons.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=2c25175d-98f5-474c-bd1b-1c285ad79c0a\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"16824f8a-8fcb-5dfc-8bec-61c51ba4bb7c"}}
