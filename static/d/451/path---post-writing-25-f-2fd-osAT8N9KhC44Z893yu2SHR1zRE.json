{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Writing","content":"<p>\nSometimes I like to think of myself as a writer, but as my girlfriend is wont to pointing out I must actually <em>write </em>something now and anon to be considered a writer, otherwise I&#39;m just a regular old bloke. And I do admit that I write far too little so last week I opened a <a href=\"http://forum.seraph-inn.com/index.php?showtopic=6437\" target=\"_blank\">thread on a forum</a>  asking for tuples of four words and a sentence to get me to writing. So far it&#39;s actually been very helpful, I&#39;ve managed to write three short stories in a week, which is about thrice the amount I usually write in two or three months.\n</p>\n<p>\nHowever, I&#39;ve noticed, that writing like this has a flaw. Sure it gets you writing and yes it&#39;s a good motivator, but what you produce, at least what <strong>I</strong> produce is utter trash without even a hint of any real meaning, let alone deepness and susbstantiality. All they are is a funky little story that spurred out of a few random words and a phrase.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I&#39;m writing for me, that is when I wait and procrastinate and then wait some more and then after something&#39;s been tossing around my thick skull for a few months and finally get down to writing it what comes out is much deeper, much more meaningful and actually says something beyond being just a lame old trash story. Although I must say style-wise it&#39;s not much better.\n</p>\n<p>\nSee the problem I have with style isn&#39;t necessarily that my style of writing is bad per se, it&#39;s actually very nice to read and sucks you right in wanting to learn more and more of the story, or so I&#39;m told. The problem lies elsewhere, it&#39;s that all my characters lack a certain life, my dialogues lack a certain organic quality to them. Everything I write down feels somewhat out of place since the story does flow naturally, but everyone in it is stiff as wood and when they talk it&#39;s everything but natural.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis stems, I think, from similar issues Lovecraft had and I would hate to fall in the same pit he did with his writing.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f0642a85-a826-5ac8-baea-e22e553dd234"}}
