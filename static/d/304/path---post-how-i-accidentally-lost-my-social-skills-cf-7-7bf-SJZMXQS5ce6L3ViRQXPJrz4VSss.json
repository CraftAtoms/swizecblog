I could strike up a conversation with anyone anywhere. I could walk up to a girl, say hi, and spend the next twenty minutes in fascinating conversation.</p>\n<p>They all got confused when I wouldn&#8217;t ask for their number. But I had my fun.</p>\n<p>52 straight weeks in bars. Sometimes more than once a week. I wasn&#8217;t getting drunk, I went there to hang out and have fun talking to random people.</p>\n<p>For an introverted nerd who spent years afraid of talking to girls and fudging about for hours before picking up the phone to call someone this was huge.</p>\n<p>My quest to getting epic <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Social skills\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_skills\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">social skills</a> started a few years earlier when I had to learn &#8220;this networking thing&#8221;. One of my favourite moments was inviting the internet for tea when I first came to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Silicon Valley\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.37,-122.04&amp;spn=1.0,1.0&amp;q=37.37,-122.04 (Silicon%20Valley)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">Silicon Valley</a>. Many responded and I ended up having pleasant conversations over tea with about ten of them. Fun.</p>\n<p>For a while I even went partying once a week religiously. Much expense, many hangovers, and plenty nights being That Wird Guy Who Is Alone At A Club I learned how to get any girl talking to me.</p>\n<p>The trick is you shouldn&#8217;t care. One of the more interesting conversations started with <em>&#8220;Hey, you have nice boobs.&#8221;</em> in response to which I learned that she was from Australia and it must be a European thing to say things like that.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a European thing.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img alt=\"San Francisco\" src=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/cbea837d8db67dd6c4762f8487cdaff9/tumblr_mwfqhuspxN1qekjngo1_500.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">San Francisco</p></div>\n<p>But last autumn life got busy. I started writing books. My freelancing started picking up. Suddenly was spending my days cooped up in my room. Working. Writing. Sleeping.</p>\n<p>Despite having enough money to actually afford going out a lot, I never did. Eventually I stopped even going out for groceries. Family brought them anyway.</p>\n<p>The only thing that got me out of the house on a regular basis was boxing practice.</p>\n<p>I even started making friends at the gym, which is something I&#8217;d never done before. Sports are a place I go to be away from people. Making friends at the gym was a bad sign indeed. Something was up.</p>\n<p>Three weeks ago I came back to the Valley. My social circle is confined to the same house and roughly the same people I was with in June. Sure I have all my old friends on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Internet Relay Chat\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">IRC</a>, but it&#8217;s not the same.</p>\n<p>When I go outside everyone is a stranger. I don&#8217;t walk up to them to say hi. I don&#8217;t do anything to break the stranger barrier. I barely even talk to service people, it feels weird.</p>\n<p>Going out is no better.</p>\n<p>There was a cute girl at the bar last week. A luscious redhead. After 20 minutes of gathering courage I walked up to her friend and said <em>&#8220;Hi, have you seen how shiny my boots are?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p><em>&#8220;No I haven&#8217;t&#8221;</em>, she turned away.</p>\n<p>I tried to engage her again, to no avail. Somewhere along the line I had lost my ability to talk to girls. And that wasn&#8217;t even a bad opener! A year ago I could&#8217;ve gotten a long conversation out of that one.</p>\n<p>It gets worse.</p>\n<p>On Saturday I met a bunch of new people in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"San Francisco\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7833333333,-122.416666667&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.7833333333,-122.416666667 (San%20Francisco)&amp;t=h\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"geolocation\">SF</a> and because everyone was really into trying out their social game, I had five conversations in half an hour. My head spun and in the middle of talking to someone I ran to the bathroom and vomited.</p>\n<p>It might have been the dehydration coupled with drinking too much liquid all at once, but it wasn&#8217;t a good reaction to have regardless.</p>\n<p>My social skills have gone off. Left in the fridge for too long they went bad like week old Indian food.</p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. Considering I have the discipline to work out a good hour a day, I should be able to spend at least <em>some</em> time a week working on my social skills.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, it&#8217;s time to start visiting coffee shops and bars again. I don&#8217;t yet know how I&#8217;m going to make sure I have interesting conversations when writing from a coffee shop, but damn it I&#8217;m going to think of something.</p>\n<p>Even if it takes sticking a note saying <em>&#8220;New to the area. Come say hi&#8221;</em> to the back of my laptop.</p>\n<p>Wish me luck.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=3f574e08-70a9-4df6-93fa-2501dfddb027\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"295e841f-b993-5806-80f8-de615c973264"}}
