{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Powernaps and gambling","content":"<p>Powernapping is a practice of having a <em>short sleep which terminates before the occurrence of deep sleep or slow-wave sleep (SWS), intended to quickly revitalize the subject from drowsiness. </em>as per wikipedia. Somehow I&#8217;ve never been one for powernaps, but last night I was so knackered and still had so much to do that I decided to go and try have a powernap. Knackerness came from having walked to and from the gym in cold weather, it&#8217;s a thirty minute walk each way &#8230; anyhow.</p>\n<p>Because I remember my past experience with powernaps I&#8217;d decided to try doing it with a movie on, that should keep me focused and get up soon enough right? Well, no, I woke up this morning, six hours later. Some powernap! And so I found that gambling didn&#8217;t work out at all this time and I probably won&#8217;t try having a powernap ever again.</p>\n<p>However, I do remember once making good use of a technique much similar to powernapping, the so called meditation. I used to push myself into REM every midnight like clockwork, stay in REM for about ten or so minutes and then get back to work. Doing this I could sleep for an average of three or four hours a night without much trouble at all, but somehow, over the years I&#8217;ve gotten less and less punctual with my meditations until they finally became quite sporadic and to the current point where I&#8217;m lucky if I meditate three times a week.</p>\n<p>This has got to change, as @gregbrand said, &#8220;just do it&#8221;. And he&#8217;s right, I should just stop whining and go fucking meditate every midnight when the alarm goes off. NOT pushing the alarm forward two hours and then just turning it off. No, I WILL meditate and I <em>will </em>get my previous ability of instameditation back. It&#8217;s going to take a lot of practice, but I&#8217;m gonna stick with it. Hell, if I can go to the gym every day for two hours, I should be able to take 20 minutes a night and force myself to meditate right?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7b3bcf81-31b7-5de8-8800-29e2387d2007"}}
