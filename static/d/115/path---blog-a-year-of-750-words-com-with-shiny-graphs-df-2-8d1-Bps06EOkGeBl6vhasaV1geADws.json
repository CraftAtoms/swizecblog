It&#8217;s like morning exercise but for your brain &#8211; very awesome for waking up and forcing the brain to get up to speed and ready to face the day.</p>\n<p>And it&#8217;s very liberating too. Since you&#8217;re not writing for anybody, not even for yourself (I often mash out the whole thing with my eyes closed) you can say literally anything about anyone or anything. Sometimes things come out you didn&#8217;t even know you were thinking!</p>\n<p>Awesomer still is the fact you now have a deep dataset about yourself. Your mood, your thoughts, going back &#8230; very far. Seeing your feelings in such plasticity is quite interesting.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a graph of my mood for the past 384 days.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://swizec.github.com/750words-analysis/\" width=\"700\" height=\"1800\" style=\"border: 0px\"></iframe></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://scriblinmind.wordpress.com/2012/05/16/how-to-become-interesting-with-graphs/\" target=\"_blank\">How To Become Interesting (with Graphs)</a> (scriblinmind.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://writeofinitiation.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/were-going-to-need-a-bigger-graph/\" target=\"_blank\">We&#8217;re Going To Need A Bigger Graph</a> (writeofinitiation.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://householdopera.typepad.com/household_opera/2010/06/in-praise-of-750-words.html\" target=\"_blank\">In praise of 750 Words</a> (householdopera.typepad.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/katienotopoulos/can-a-graph-of-a-news-articles-words-tell-you-mor\" target=\"_blank\">Can A Graph Of A News Article&#8217;s Words Tell You More Than Reading It?</a> (buzzfeed.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=38799454-438e-4f6f-9b23-117a086ca22a\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"03f78415-8e54-5068-b80b-0d645aeda5c9"}}
