That my online profile looked interesting and so on &#8230; at first I almost dismissed it as spam &#8211; surely they send these out by the hundreds every day?</p>\n<p>But hey, nothing to lose if I reply, right?</p>\n<p>After I changed the agreed date of our video chat a couple of times &#8211; even forgot to respond to an email for two weeks &#8211; we finally got together. That was just your run of the mill blahblah with an HR person. What kind of stuff I like, what Google is all about, the fact they have shiny new offices in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"London\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.5072222222,-0.1275&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=51.5072222222,-0.1275 (London)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\">London</a> and are looking for people to fill them with and so on.</p>\n<p>Mind you, I don&#8217;t know whether I actually want to work for Google. They&#8217;re a huge company and working for them would fly right in the face of <a title=\"Why I only work with startups\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-i-only-work-with-startups/swizec/2936\">my principle to only work with startups</a>! On the other hand, just being able to say I&#8217;ve worked at Google, even for a short while, would look <em>incredibly</em> well on my CV.</p>\n<p>But hey, no sense worrying about this stuff until they offer me a job. Fuck it, let&#8217;s give the interviewing process a shot &#8211; looks like an interesting challenge anyway. Challenge accepted, I want to win.</p>\n<p>They agreed to give me a call a month later, when I&#8217;d be done with exams. Yes, Google is in fact that nice. No rush, whenever you have time, you don&#8217;t want to even consider working before September? Fine with us. Please just let us talk to you kthxbai.</p>\n<p>Yesterday was a month later.</p>\n<h2>The interview</h2>\n<p>Funny thing is, Google goes to great length to put you at ease about the whole process. They&#8217;re nice to you, send you friendly sounding email and at the same time everything looks <em>so</em> bureaucratized you can&#8217;t help but feel ever so slightly nervous.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s even detailed instructions for making sure you can be called via <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Talk\" href=\"http://www.google.com/talk/\" rel=\"homepage\">GTalk</a>!</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3822\" style=\"width: 402px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-3822  \" title=\"Google London HQ\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK.jpg\" alt=\"Google London HQ\" width=\"392\" height=\"294\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK.jpg 800w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK-300x225.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 392px) 100vw, 392px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Google London HQ</p></div>\n<p>And the email says <em>don&#8217;t you dare type on your laptop, the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Interview\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interview\" rel=\"wikipedia\">interviewer</a> will <strong>hear</strong> you!</em> Of course the interviewer spent the entire conversation happily clickety-clacking away at his laptop &#8230; it <em>is</em> in fact slightly annoying.</p>\n<p>Andrew was a cool guy, very good with asking cool questions and letting me run amok &#8211; undoubtedly making an arse of myself several times when I climbed into a wall trying to explain a concept I introduced to the conversation and then backtracking to where I still made sense and trying to explain it differently.</p>\n<p>The conversation had a light structure, felt like having a technical chat with a friend over some drinks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>describe a cool recent project, go into the technical nitty gritty</li>\n<li>what&#8217;s an exception and how does it work</li>\n<li>what is a memory leak and how would you go about debugging it</li>\n<li>automated testing! talk, go!</li>\n<li>write some code to create <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerset\" target=\"_blank\">powersets</a></li>\n<li>how would you look for a file containing a keyword in a deeply-ish nested directory structure</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have no idea how well I answered the questions &#8230; you know how these things are, you can explain at great detail what you <em>think</em> something is and how it behaves. But you might well be completely wrong.</p>\n<p>The funniest part was after I explained a recent project (<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Time series\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series\" rel=\"wikipedia\">time-series analysis</a> for predicting how much money I&#8217;ll have in two weeks) and Andrew&#8217;s response was something along the lines of <em>&#8220;Oh that&#8217;s really cool! Do you have any plans on making it into a service? &#8230; wait, I&#8217;m interviewing you for Google &#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>He seemed a bit confused.</p>\n<p>Another interesting moment was when I was explaining <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Memory leak\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak\" rel=\"wikipedia\">memory leaks</a>. He was looking for an answer inside the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Java (programming language)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Java</a> or C++ world (even made sure I knew them beforehand) and instead I explained that a cool way of getting memory leaks with javascript is through closures that are left hanging. I did also give the answer he was looking for, but off-handedly.</p>\n<p>That somehow sent me into a long explanation of what closures are and how the concept is neatly related to continuations and function curling. And what <em>those</em> are. He generally let me wander around with my answers, probably trying to poke into what I do know and what I don&#8217;t, even if it&#8217;s beyond the scope of specific questions.</p>\n<h2>Coding under pressure</h2>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>There was some coding involved &#8211; a very simple task. <em>What is a powerset,</em> blah<em>, yes you got it. Now code something in your favorite language to turn a set into its powerset.</em></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3823\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK_-_Victoria.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-3823\" title=\"Google London HQ\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK_-_Victoria-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"Google London HQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK_-_Victoria-300x225.jpg 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/800px-Google_London_UK_-_Victoria.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Google London HQ</p></div>\n<p>Not even in my worst nightmare could I imagine coding live, with somebody looking directly at my output, would be <strong>so</strong> difficult! It&#8217;s amazing, you go there and you think<em> ah! yes, I know this! This is simple stuff!</em></p>\n<p>You start &#8230; nothing.</p>\n<p>I spent four or five attempts climbing myself into a wall and deleting all my code before finally producing a cool looking algorithm &#8211; a lovely non-recursive solution; simply because I couldn&#8217;t think of a recursive solution, just knew that the simplest solution is supposed to be a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Recursion (computer science)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_%28computer_science%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">recursive algorithm</a>.</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\">def powerset(set):\r\n      binaries = [bin(a) for a in range(2^len(set))]\r\n      power = []\r\n      for yeses in binaries:\r\n        subset = []\r\n\tyeses = str(yeses)\r\n\tfor i in range(len(yeses)):\r\n                 if yeses[i] == “1”:\r\n        \t\tsubset.append(set[i])\r\n\tpower.append(subset)\r\n      return power</pre>\n<p>This is whiteboard python. The syntax for calculating a power is wrong and I&#8217;m fairly certain <em>bin</em> isn&#8217;t an actual function in standard library. I&#8217;m also not sure converting a binary number to a string works quite as I envision it here, might need to use <em>&#8220;%d&#8221; % blah</em> syntax.</p>\n<p>But the general idea is simple: take all binary numbers from zero to the powerset&#8217;s length, iterate through them and use digits as binary switches for picking elements to put into each subset.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25923412@N00/2576981899\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Google 的貼牌冰箱（Google refrigerator）\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2576981899_fef76fd366_m1.jpg\" alt=\"Google 的貼牌冰箱（Google refrigerator）\" width=\"240\" height=\"182\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Google 的貼牌冰箱（Google refrigerator） (Photo credit: Aray Chen)</p></div>\n<p>It took me forever to deduce the formula for calculating the size of a powerset from first principles. Couldn&#8217;t remember it. Looked at the examples I generated in my head &#8230; <em>&#8220;Ok, so every time you add an element, you double the size of the powerset. n^2 &#8230; no that&#8217;s not it &#8230; could it possibly be 2^n? Damn it! yes, that&#8217;s it!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>But Andrew reassured me he loved the solution even though it needed a bit of fixing; and you can obviously see that&#8217;s not the most elegant <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Python (programming language)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">python code</a> out there.</p>\n<h2>And now we wait</h2>\n<p>In general I think I managed to convince Andrew that even though my explanations often came with a <em>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t looked into how this works <strong>exactly, </strong>but here&#8217;s my understanding of what should be going on&#8221;</em> I know a fair bit about technology and if push came to shove, I could code my way out of a wet paper bag to save a life.</p>\n<p>If he got the same impression, the next step is a full day of back-to-back technical interviews at Google&#8217;s London offices.</p>\n<p>First though, we wait for &#8220;my&#8221; recruiter to get back to me about how the phone conversation went.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://jhucareercenter.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/interview-like-an-ace-helpful-tips/\">Interview like an ace: Helpful tips</a> (jhucareercenter.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9187448/further-clarification-of-an-ie7-memory-leak\">Further clarification of an IE7 Memory Leak</a> (stackoverflow.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.gottabemobile.com/2012/03/02/google-wallet-coming-to-10-more-sprint-android-phones-in-2012/\">Google Wallet Coming to 10 More Sprint Android Phones in 2012</a> (gottabemobile.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://e-clecticism.blogspot.com/2012/02/image-recursion.html\">Image Recursion</a> (e-clecticism.blogspot.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9509060/appending-title-to-google-event-tracking-code\">Appending Title to Google Event Tracking Code</a> (stackoverflow.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/blog/semantic-tech-conference-quick-report/\">Semantic Tech Conference quick report</a> (zemanta.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=5ef03a4a-3086-4972-b4f6-b6ac07633ebd\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8da1fbb6-b728-5f03-b8d2-1c4ac1205c9b"}}
