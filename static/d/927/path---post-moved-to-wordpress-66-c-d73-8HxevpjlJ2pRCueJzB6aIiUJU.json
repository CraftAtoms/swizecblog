Moving all the data went surprisingly simply and there wasn&#8217;t too much work in translating posts. I even managed to preserve all the tags and whatnot so no content was lost. What&#8217;s even better, since wordpress allows different types of permalinks I was able to preserve any and all inbound links that might be floating around the web.</p>\n<p>On a darker side I lost all images I&#8217;d ever uploaded to the previous platform due to my stupidity in deleting a directory I shouldn&#8217;t have. Of course there was no backup and the lovely FTP client doesn&#8217;t offer an undo for such serious actions.</p>\n<p>Using wordpress will also allow me to poke around the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Zemanta\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com\">Zemanta</a> plugin so I can see if it&#8217;s really as great as they keep telling me it is. So far I&#8217;ve only ever seen in it in action on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Jure Cuhalev\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.jurecuhalev.com/blog\">Jure Cuhalev</a>&#8216;s blog where it seemed &#8230; somewhat quirky. Will see how it performs in my neck of the woods.</p>\n<p>Most of you probably don&#8217;t miss my old custom made design that I toiled with for many hours, but I do. So at some point in the future, most probably next weekend, I will bring some of it back with a vengence. Just you wait.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Zemified by Zemanta\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/3a41f717-f8b8-401f-ad3d-439c38d97552/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=3a41f717-f8b8-401f-ad3d-439c38d97552\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d9e81b40-664d-5ea1-af04-7dd1b1a0cb95"}}
