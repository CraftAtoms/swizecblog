Partly because they were famous and venues would do anything to get them, partly because people could literally die.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Van_Halen_-_Jump_2007-11-10.jpg\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Van Halen performs their song &quot;Jump&quot;...\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/300px-Van_Halen_-_Jump_2007-11-102.jpg\" alt=\"Van Halen performs their song &quot;Jump&quot;...\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>The contract was full of useful things like &#8220;The floor should support such and such weight&#8221; and &#8220;We need power outlets there and there and there [or our guitars won&#8217;t work and you&#8217;ll have a shitty show]&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the middle of nowhere was a demand for <em>a bowl of M&amp;M&#8217;s backstage, without any brown pieces</em>.</p>\n<p>An outlandish request, by flamboyant rockstars stretching their decadence? Not really, just a very good way to make sure the contract was followed to the letter and, you know, they&#8217;d survive the show. Find a brown piece &#8211; go check over the whole production. You <em>will</em> find something wrong.</p>\n<p>With the current startup climate developers are the modern rockstars. We may not get all the groupies and we may be quite well behaved for the most part &#8211; but it&#8217;s time we started making fun outlandish requests don&#8217;t you think?</p>\n<p>Designers are usually seen as the extravagant bit of the startup world, getting all the cool toys, working from rooms filled with inspiration and mojo &#8230; developers concern themselves much less with these things &#8211; give us a good set of monitors, free reign on our computer, some peace and quiet and we&#8217;ll be happy.</p>\n<p>But when there are so many opportunities out there, you need a brown M&amp;M so you don&#8217;t end up wasting even a day at a company that doesn&#8217;t quite live up to expectations.</p>\n<p>For me, the brown M&amp;M is <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Revision control\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control\" rel=\"wikipedia\">version control</a>.</p>\n<p>If a company isn&#8217;t using git or mercurial, I can be pretty certain there will be other problems as well. Everything from a shoddy codebase, to expecting my physical presence before my brain has had a chance to boot in the morning.</p>\n<p>Usually the use of old-ish tools also correlates with a corporate feel to the company, which goes directly against <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-i-only-work-with-startups/swizec/2936\">my rule of only working with [small] startups</a>. Plus it usually means I won&#8217;t be given freedom in choosing the best technology stack for the job, but will have something mandated from above.</p>\n<p>I could probably go on, but you can imagine the rest. Use of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apache Subversion\" href=\"http://subversion.apache.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">SVN</a> or, god forbid, nothing, is a deal breaker for me and it&#8217;s the symptom I can discover very early in the process &#8230; haven&#8217;t gone so far as putting it in the contract yet.</p>\n<p>Do you use a brown M&amp;M technique to assess potential clients?</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2012/01/01/no-brown-mms-david-lee-roth-and-the-power-of-checklists/\">No Brown M&amp;M&#8217;s!
