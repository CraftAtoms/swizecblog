At first I would blog exactly twice a week on specific days, eventualy I started blogging daily.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the strange thing &#8211; it actually worked.</p>\n<p>By blogging every day I have ensured not all of my posts will be super brilliant, but the sheer amount of practice I&#8217;m getting has meant that even on my worst days I can simply sit down and pump something out. Even if it&#8217;s dreck, even if I feel nobody will be interested. Such posts only end up as a reminder for people that hey, there&#8217;s this blog, you sometimes like it &#8230; it&#8217;s still alive. Just letting you know!</p>\n<p>Last week something strange happened.</p>\n<p>I filled my monthly &#8220;quota&#8221; in a single week &#8230; somehow my little <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Blog\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog\" rel=\"wikipedia\">personal blog</a> managed to garner the attention of 32,820 visitors. What&#8217;s stranger still, 96% of these visits were from Friday to Sunday. Mostly because of two posts.</p>\n<p>Not sure exactly what happened, but apparently people love being told that startups are awesome and <a title=\"Why I only work with startups\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-i-only-work-with-startups/swizec/2936\">why I love working for them</a>. Another thing that really seems to pique people&#8217;s interests are <a title=\"Strangest line of python you have ever seen\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/strangest-line-of-python-you-have-ever-seen/swizec/3012\">strange lines of python</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3026\" style=\"width: 729px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.07.47-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3026 \" title=\"A good blogging week\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.07.47-PM.png\" alt=\"A good blogging week\" width=\"719\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.07.47-PM.png 1027w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.07.47-PM-300x109.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.07.47-PM-1024x374.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">A good blogging week</p></div>\n<p>Those two posts together have been tweeted 242 and G+&#8217;d 38 times. Strangely though, this does not beat the record holder &#8211; a post about <a title=\"Apple’s Ping is a big pile of steaming dung\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/apples-ping-is-a-big-pile-of-steaming-dung/swizec/1444\">apple&#8217;s ping being a big pile of steaming dung</a> &#8211; which managed to get 248 tweets on its own.</p>\n<p>But all these visits and tweets and comments (about 30 per post) don&#8217;t mean a single thing without the very important metric of how many people actually read them?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m happy to say that the post about startups was read to its completion by about 38% of visitors &#8211; for a 1000+ word behemot that&#8217;s <em>a lot</em> on the internet. The python post also did remarkably well with a 65% completion rate! Yay!</p>\n<p>I think the python post can easily be explained by all the expert pythoners looking for the punchline since it turned out that line wasn&#8217;t so much strange as me and my friends are stupid.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3027\" style=\"width: 688px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.14.29-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3027 \" title=\"Even long posts can have good completion rates\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.14.29-PM.png\" alt=\"Even long posts can have good completion rates\" width=\"678\" height=\"316\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.14.29-PM.png 969w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.14.29-PM-300x139.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 678px) 100vw, 678px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Even long posts can have good completion rates</p></div>\n<div id=\"attachment_3028\" style=\"width: 695px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.15.38-PM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-3028 \" title=\"Short confusing posts do _very_ well\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.15.38-PM.png\" alt=\"Short confusing posts do _very_ well\" width=\"685\" height=\"312\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.15.38-PM.png 979w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Screen-Shot-2011-11-21-at-7.15.38-PM-300x136.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Short confusing posts do _very_ well</p></div>\n<p>You might think the stats for the python post are poisoned by the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Startup company\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company\" rel=\"wikipedia\">startup</a> post doing so well, but according to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Google Analytics\" href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics\" rel=\"homepage\">google analytics</a> there was so much significantly more traffic on the python post that this is practically negligible.
