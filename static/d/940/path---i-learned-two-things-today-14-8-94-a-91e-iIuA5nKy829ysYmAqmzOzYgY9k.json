Was at Pier 2 in San Francisco this morning after a night of partying at DNA Lounge and it turns out turning on my iPad and mashing out the <a title=\"750 words a day keeps the insanity away\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/750-words-a-day-keeps-the-insanity-away/swizec/1703\">750 words I write every morning</a> on the portable keyboard is one of the most fun things I&#8217;ve ever done.</p>\n<p>The view in sunny weather is really brilliant as well.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that Grant Imahara is a really cool guy. He was at the club and reacted really well to my going disturbing his date to ask for a photo of him with my hat.
