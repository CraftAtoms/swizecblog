Something&#8217;s gone terribly wrong ðŸ¤”</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, I got so busy launching <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js\">React+D3v4</a> that I didn&#8217;t publish anything on <a href=\"http://reactnative.school\">React Native School</a>. That revenue is based on articles published, no articles published, no revenue. Oops. ðŸ˜‡</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s all good though, the sidehustle revenue for September is going to look spectacular. I&#8217;m excited already!</p>\n<p>A smart business man once said to me: Money does not exist until it becomes cash in bank.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not your money until it&#8217;s your money. Anything could happen. Oh you got a contract for a bunch of cash? Might get cancelled. Oh you did a bunch of work for someone? Maybe they&#8217;ll go bust. Someone already wired you the cash but it hasn&#8217;t arrived yet? Your bank might reject it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s happened to me before. Client wired me money, mis-spelled my name, bank rejected the transfer. ðŸ’©</p>\n<p>In short: Yes, I launched React+D3v4 on August 16. Yes it made sales. No, it didn&#8217;t hit my account until September.</p>\n<p>Gumroad makes payouts on Friday the week after. Revenue for the week of August 26th is hitting my account on Friday, September 8th. Last Friday was already September so React+D3v4 had no effect on August revenue.</p>\n<p>This scheduling quirk made my graph of monthly revenue look sad. The trend line in particular is cause for worry. ðŸ˜•</p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7783\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-00.18.33.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-00.18.33.png 550w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-08-at-00.18.33-300x232.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" />\n<p>Here&#8217;s August in numbers ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<p><strong>Total Revenue:</strong> $2629</p>\n<p><strong>Gumroad sales:</strong> $1317</p>\n<ul>\n<li>React+D3v4 preorder: $685</li>\n<li>React+D3 ES6: $472</li>\n<li>ES6 cheatsheet: $19</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Leanpub sales:</strong> $312</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why programmers work at night: $47</li>\n<li>React+D3: $33</li>\n<li>React+D3v4: $231</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>React/JavaScript coaching:</strong> $1000</p>\n<p><strong>LiveEdu premium:</strong> $4</p>\n<p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 66 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Expenses:</strong> $1812<br />\n&#8211; Editor: $500<br />\n&#8211; VA: $400<br />\n&#8211; FB Ads: $176<br />\n&#8211; PonyFoo sponsorship: $250<br />\n&#8211; Domains: $131<br />\n&#8211; Dreamhost: $33<br />\n&#8211; AWS: $14<br />\n&#8211; now.sh: $15<br />\n&#8211; Webfaction: $10<br />\n&#8211; Drip: $184<br />\n&#8211; SumoMe: $99</p>\n<p>Why the fuck did I buy $131 worth of domains?
