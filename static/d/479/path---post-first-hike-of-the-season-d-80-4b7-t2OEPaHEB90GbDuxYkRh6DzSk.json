Does this mean I&#8217;m getting old? Or just that I spend too much time inside?</p>\n<p>Whatever it is, yesterday the girlfriend and I went for a lovely hike. The first of the season. The destination was this <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/observation_tower\" title=\"Observation tower\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_tower\">observation tower</a> thing upon some hill above Vrhnika.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://foursquare.com/venue/2957164\">I foursquared</a> when we were there of course ðŸ˜›</p>\n<p>The hike was quite lovely through some woods and such, many birds were chirping and there were no mammals in sight except for some cyclist a dog or two and a few children. There were also some humans.</p>\n<p>An hour of walking each way &#8230; it hurt a lot more than I thought it would. No soreness today, but it was surprisingly hard yesterday and I felt strangely sleepy as early as midnight. Maybe I&#8217;m just not at all in shape yet?</p>\n<p>Anyhow, here are two photos of the purdiful view we got from the top of the tower.</p>\n<div class=\"row-fluid\"><ul class=\"thumbnails\"><li class=\"span2\"><a class=\"thumbnail\" href='https://swizec.com/blog/first-hike-of-the-season/swizec/1317/img00364'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG00364-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a></li><li class=\"span2\"><a class=\"thumbnail\" href='https://swizec.com/blog/first-hike-of-the-season/swizec/1317/img00363'><img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/IMG00363-150x150.jpg\" class=\"attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail\" alt=\"\" /></a></li></ul></div>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/5cdcd674-ba89-409a-9ee9-fa1a55421f7c/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=5cdcd674-ba89-409a-9ee9-fa1a55421f7c\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"54a93e1c-d550-52ca-90ee-bdc624fb3c38"}}
