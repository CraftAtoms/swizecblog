{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"My twitter goals","content":"<p>Initially I wanted to write this as a comment to <a href=\"http://www.twitip.com/defining-twitter-goals-a-tip-for-successful-use-of-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">TwiTip.com&#8217;s Twitter goals post</a>, but it grew and grew and felt more like a blogpost of its own.</p>\n<p>I use twitter to be a popular twitterer. That&#8217;s the only goal I really have.</p>\n<p>But there are hidden goals of course. Like just _what_ comes from being a powerful twitterer? Well there&#8217;s the personal branding thing, everyone&#8217;s doing it right now and it&#8217;s useful for a number of things pretty much everyone knows. Another thing powerful twitterers have is an instant readerbase, have a new project? Announce it on twitter and instantly hundreds of people know about it &#8230; that&#8217;s a very powerful promotion tool.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, is the knowledge aspect of being a powerful twitterer. You find out many things, very many things you find out near instantly and a lot of that information is in fact very good, useful information. The old saying goes &#8220;Valuable information is only valuable while it&#8217;s fresh&#8221;. Ding ding.</p>\n<p>So yeah, twitter goals, I say don&#8217;t go overboard, just go out there and have fun. The rest will follow.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b030c35-8340-535c-865e-ab01612c5d26"}}
