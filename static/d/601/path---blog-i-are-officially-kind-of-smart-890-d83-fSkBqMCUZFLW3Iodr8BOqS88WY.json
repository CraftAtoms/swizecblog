{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"I are officially kind of smart","content":"<p>Some of you might remember my taking a <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/took-iq-test-found-problem/2/388\">Mensa approved IQ test</a> about a week ago, well today, finally, results came in and what I found out was surprisingiy similar to what I&#8217;d already known. My IQ seems to be 134, which is supposedly in the top 6% of the human population &#8211; not perfect, but good enough I say, I&#8217;ve got objective proof that I&#8217;m smart rather than stupid as I so often feel I am.</p>\n<p>But how on earth did I know I&#8217;d get about that result? Online IQ tests to be honest, for some reason I&#8217;ve been nearly obsessed with knowing my IQ for the past few years and have thus solved many online tests. Some better, some worse. The results, accordingly, varied quite a lot, but a clear median shined out from the masses and that was 130-ish.</p>\n<p>See, I knew enough not to trust the tests that want to sell me their results, the whole point of those is giving a high score so you&#8217;d be tempted to buy the advanced results. I also knew not to trust the tests that asked for too much knowledge because hey, how am I supposed to know what a friggin&#8217; nickel or dime is?</p>\n<p>Lately, however, I&#8217;ve solved <a href=\"http://apps.facebook.com/advancediqtest/\" target=\"_blank\">the facebook IQ test</a> and found it to be the most accurate of them all and it in fact showed a result quite similar to that of Mensa&#8217;s test. Facebook says my IQ is 143 and given the fact that performance can vary between days, that I took the facebook test in my natural environment, nighttime, and some other factors, I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s a rather accurate way of gleaning one&#8217;s IQ.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"29f27d97-db68-5eff-afe6-85201ae7a971"}}
