{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Online buzz is quite cool","content":"<p>Yesterday I had my first ever experience in being on the receiving end of some proper online buzz with <a href=\"http://twitulater.com\" target=\"_blank\">Twitulater</a>. It started out with <a href=\"http://blog.go2web20.net/2009/02/twitulater-is-so-great-why-does-it-have.html\" target=\"_blank\">a writeup on go2web2.0</a>, which I thought was just another blog mentioning Twitulater, two days ago. Hey cool, so I commented. How wrong I was!</p>\n<p>The blog turned out to be something read by a lot of people, even, it would seem a somewhat important blog since the very next day when I searched twitter for mentions there were a <a href=\"http://search.twitter.com/search?q=twitulater\" target=\"_blank\">TON</a>. I think the number stopped at just over 20 and although I realise that&#8217;s not a lot for many products out there, but it&#8217;s quite a big deal to me. Best part was how I even got some congrats from people for that writeup. Yay!</p>\n<p>All of this had a wonderful consequence of website visits being about ten times larger than usual yesterday. Sure, in my case this meant only 100 visits, but for a project that usually gets under ten visits a day, I do think getting a hundred is magnificent. In fact, some microblogging service contacted me and asked if I could integrate their API. Haven&#8217;t replies yet, but it&#8217;s looking very likely to happen.</p>\n<p>Must say I&#8217;m quite glad how well Twitulater is turning out as a project and it&#8217;s almost unbelievable that, with all the other stuff going on in my life, I&#8217;ve come so far in a mere four months. Loving the whole ride!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"09085bfe-87c8-5a4b-8cae-9368dc35fabb"}}
