{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Poking a sleeping giant","content":"<p>The first <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Postcard\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcard\" rel=\"wikipedia\">postcard</a> is said to have appeared in 1840 &#8211; it was a hand painted design on a piece of thick paper, sent with a penny black stamp to the writer <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Theodore Hook\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Hook\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Theodore Hook</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 260px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><img title=\"First postcard\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Conlie_postcard.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"169\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">First postcard</p></div>\n<p>Since then not much has changed, the stock image postcards appeared in1848 as part of some sort of advertising. The modern postcard was born around 1870 when <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Camp Conlie\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Conlie\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Camp Conlie</a> started offering stock postcards with photos of the place to send home as a memory.</p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 1.3em;\">tl;dr -&gt; <a href=\"http://postme.me\">postme.me</a> is making postcards cool again</em></p>\n<p>And that pretty much cemented the fate of the postcard. For the past 140 years they have mostly been seen as a way to send a picture of where you were for vacation back home to family or friends. The most variance happens in the form of holiday greeting cards, sometimes you&#8217;ll see a postcard with a cheesy joke as well &#8230; I think I&#8217;ve seen all 10 already. And they&#8217;re the kind of joke your dad finds funny.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. <em>That</em> is a <em>five billion dollar industry</em>. Or so I&#8217;ve heard &#8230; either way, something as lame as that is big business.</p>\n<p>How nobody has gone and poked in this hive before is beyond belief.</p>\n<p>Then suddenly, in early 2011, disruptors start popping up. Suddenly everyone thinks you should be able to send postcards electronically and easily. Just take a photo with your iphone or something, click a few buttons, and voila, some hapless victim gets a nice postcard.</p>\n<p>Now you can go on vacation and send back home what you actually see. A beautiful picture, filtered to the 70&#8217;s, and everybody is happy. <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/26/sincerely-raises-3-million-to-deliver-real-world-postcards-holiday-cards-on-the-way/\" target=\"_blank\">Sincerely even got a 3 million dollar investment</a> last week for doing just that &#8211; letting people send boring postcards more easily. There&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://www.picplum.com/\" target=\"_blank\">picplum</a>, which lets people mail gorgeously printed photos and was funded by YC this summer.</p>\n<p>Boring.</p>\n<p>A huge 140 year old industry and the best disruption we can come up with is making it marginally easier to use? What the hell is wrong with everyone!?</p>\n<p>There is a whole generation of people coming out of college and into the working world right now who have grown up with the internet. A generation of people who don&#8217;t really care about holiday greetings or sending memories of their travels to family.</p>\n<p>But we share <em>so many</em> pictures every freaking day. Imgur is booming right now, it&#8217;s the 4chan for the everyman and it is absolutely brimming with silly pictures &#8230; often seasonal and very meaningful pictures.</p>\n<p>When my friend had a birthday two weeks ago she didn&#8217;t get a single <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Greeting card\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeting_card\" rel=\"wikipedia\">greeting card</a>. She got ten silly pictures on facebook and somebody even made her a custom rage comic. That&#8217;s right, a rage comic just to wish her a happy birthday.</p>\n<p>But that comic will be gone in the millions of other pictures within months. Or maybe she downloaded it and it will be gone in 5 years when her hard drive fails. Perhaps 10 years if she&#8217;s really careful with backups. (not to mention the thousands other pictures vying for the same sliver of attention on that hard drive)</p>\n<p>What  if instead she got that rage comic as a postcard, delivered to her address in all its glory, ready to be pinned on a wall?</p>\n<p>I think it would be much awesomer.</p>\n<p>What about Christmas? I haven&#8217;t gotten or sent a christmas card in so long I can hardly remember the tradition existing. But every year I see hundreds of funny pictures on the topic of Christmas donning the internets.</p>\n<p>I think it would be superb if some of those made it onto postcards to my friends.</p>\n<p>When I started <a href=\"http://postme.me\" target=\"_blank\">postme.me</a> I didn&#8217;t have a vision, I just wanted to make something fun. But I think there is an underlying reason why everyone likes the idea so much, young people don&#8217;t care about boring, we want fun postcards.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.firstchoice.co.uk/postcards-from-the-edge/\">Postcards From The Edge</a> (firstchoice.co.uk)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blogs.ancestry.com/uk/2011/02/10/postcard-posers-february/\">Postcard Posers &#8211; February</a> (blogs.ancestry.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://gemakarolina.wordpress.com/2011/10/31/i-sent-the-man-with-a-restless-spirit-a-postcard/\">I sent the &#8220;man with a restless spirit&#8221; a postcard</a> (gemakarolina.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/create-send-real-postcard-phone-postcard-run/\">Create &amp; Send A Real Postcard With Your Phone Using Postcard On The Run</a> (makeuseof.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2011/10/31/nypl-vintage-halloween-postcards/\">Vintage Halloween: Haunted Postcards from the 1910s</a> (brainpickings.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=878e6c75-2e0a-4454-98f6-8b63ec3f2e4e\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5dcb50bf-aa93-5085-a3e3-8bece09ef896"}}
