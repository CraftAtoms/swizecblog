Following the [hugely successful?] <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/data-visualization-with-d3js/book\">Data Visualization with d3.js book</a>, I am now working on a video course aimed at advanced users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be chock full of going into details about layouts, data manipulation, geography and other fun stuff. Definitely none of that <em>&#8220;This is how you place a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Scalable Vector Graphics\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">SVG</a> element. This is how you bind data to elements. This is how you &#8230;&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Snore.</p>\n<p>Pretty much all d3.js screencasts and courses I was able to find focus on beginners. There will be none of that here, I&#8217;m going to assume you&#8217;ve made at least three things with d3.js before tackling my videos.</p>\n<p>So roughly the same experience I&#8217;ve got.</p>\n<p>That said, I made a sample screencast last week to test the process out. The topic will fit towards the end of the course, where I try to explain the design part of visualisations.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/DHMqbJKqfQs\" height=\"315\" width=\"560\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Now, this is my first ever recording of a screencast. I have no idea what I&#8217;m doing. <em>Do not</em> be gentle! If there&#8217;s something wrong, I have to know. <em>Now!</em></p>\n<p>If you tell me I suck six months from now when the course is published, it will be too late. Tell me my accent sucks, now. Tell me I speak at a funny pace, now. Tell me you can&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m saying, now.</p>\n<p>And tell me I need a better mic. Then suggest which one I should get because this was recorded on the default apple headphones microphone.</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m going to need volunteers to beta read my scripts and beta watch the videos. The schedule says scripts will be coming out at a decent cadence of one every two weeks over the next two months. Then I&#8217;ll be making the screencasts themselves over summer and the course should be out in September.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m making this for you guys. Help me make it awesomer.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=be236c6a-a75f-4d2b-b773-b8c633e2d197\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e29bcd79-27fe-586c-891d-f63d2ea3a468"}}
