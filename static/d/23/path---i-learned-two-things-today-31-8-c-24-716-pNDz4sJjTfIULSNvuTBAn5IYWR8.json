Like did you know wood only burns at a pace of 0.6mm per minute, retains core structural integrity and that despite being the most flammable building material is still the best thing for a fire due to poor <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Thermal conductivity\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity\" rel=\"wikipedia\">heat conductivity</a> and that it doesn&#8217;t collapse under heat like metals do? Or become brittle like concrete?</p>\n<p>And &#8230; uhm &#8230; some complex stuff about why things stand up and how all of that works.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I learned was that the Official <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moleskine/id429657255?mt=8\">Moleskine iPad App</a> is <em>crap</em>. Was writing a rather lengthy blogpost last night &#8211; I find it easier to draft these things up somewhere other than the blog. Especially the more proper ones. After two hours of writing I pressed a button and the whole post vanished.</p>\n<p>No ability to get it back or anything.</p>\n<p>Moleskine iPad App &#8230; you do <em>not</em> behave like a notebook!
