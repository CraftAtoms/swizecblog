Apparently that made it more pancakey than biscuity and fluffy and the cake pan thing I was using turned out to be larger than anticipated which gave me barely enough batter to properly cover the pan wall-to-wall, which in turn made the individual layers of cake look a whole lot like pancakes.</p>\n<p>Hard, unfluffy, heavy, pancakes.</p>\n<p>I also ended up screwing up the first batch of mousse and had to run off to the store again for ingredients to make a new one. This sort of turned out alright, but should have been a bit harder and less liquid. That might work a bit better in a cake situation and be less runny.</p>\n<p>The next fail was with using the wrong recipe to make snowy white frosting. Turned out to be more yellowy white and way way not enough of it.</p>\n<p>Luckily I had just enough mousse left over to improvise and make the cake two colours on the outside.</p>\n<p>The unicorn&#8217;s corn &#8230; well I have <em>no</em> idea what that looks like &#8230;</p>\n<p>All in all, a solid 8 hours of work for a cake that sort of almost looks okay and kind of tastes alright if you&#8217;re hungry enough.</p>\n<p>Where&#8217;s git reset &#8211;hard when you need it?</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://verbalinsanity.wordpress.com/2011/08/10/project-1-rainbow-cake/\">Project #1 &#8211; Rainbow Cake.</a> (verbalinsanity.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.geeksaresexy.net/2011/10/09/best-cake-in-the-verse-pics/\">Best Cake in the &#8216;Verse?
