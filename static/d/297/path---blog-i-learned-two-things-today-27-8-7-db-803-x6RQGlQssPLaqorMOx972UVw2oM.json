I don&#8217;t remember having this much trouble last time I came back from the US; perhaps because I wasn&#8217;t there for as long and the different timezone didn&#8217;t seep into my <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Circadian rhythm\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm\" rel=\"wikipedia\">sleep cycle</a> as much? All week I&#8217;ve been getting up in the middle of the day and then being unable to fall asleep until insane morning hours (think 6 or 7am).</p>\n<p>This seems to throw my whole day into a tailspin, especially because the wakeup isn&#8217;t exactly nice and the sleep doesn&#8217;t leave me rested at all. As a result this whole week I&#8217;ve barely managed to stitch 30 productive hours together. Most of which came as the cram session for the Thursday exam. Sure hope this thing passes soon.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that with the new OAuth2 <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Foursquare\" href=\"http://www.foursquare.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Foursquare</a> API and teh awesomeness of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"JQuery\" href=\"http://jquery.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">jQuery</a> it is very <em>very</em>Â simple to make a purely browser-side Foursquare client in javascript. This comes as a great breakthrough in the way everyone can develop web apps and I think is wroth some more exploration. The first thing I&#8217;m going to try is making the footer on my blog work again since it&#8217;s been turned off because it couldn&#8217;t handle the load.</p>\n<p>Anyone know of a ready-made library existing already?</p>\n<p>Of course making soem sort of distributed cache with minimal involvement from the server will be the real issue &#8230; but definitely worth exploring.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.mycricket.com/community/cell-phone-info/checking-which-app-should-i-use\">Checking In: Which App Should I Use</a> (mycricket.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://shivasleeps.wordpress.com/2011/08/27/sleep-statistics-for-26-27-aug-fri/\">Sleep statistics for 26 &#8211; 27 Aug (Fri)</a> (shivasleeps.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://buddhavani.wordpress.com/2011/07/23/jet-lag/\">Jet Lag</a> (buddhavani.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=416ae825-a3af-4821-bd55-6ee9053854d3\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f1e01db3-5ecf-5185-9ed4-75b55cacf163"}}
