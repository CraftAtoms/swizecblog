Slovenia was getting chilly, and my barefoot running was becoming unbearable.</p>\n<p>10k was the longest distance I had run, and my time was around 1 hour. When I started a few months prior, even 4km seemed super far. Two loops around a track were plenty.</p>\n<p>A marathon is 42km, 26.2 miles. That&#8217;s just like running 10k four times back-to-back and adding two more. I figured if I can run a 10k in just under an hour, then I should be able to run a full marathon in just under 4 hours.</p>\n<p><iframe height='405' width='590' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='https://www.strava.com/activities/1098172055/embed/8a517e02361a803f7271d48b4c397cace1eea721'></iframe></p>\n<p>But this stuff doesn&#8217;t scale linearly at all. The farther you go, the slower you get, and the more your body suffers.</p>\n<p>The hard part of running a marathon is keeping your knees from blowing up, your ankles from giving in, and your feet from giving up. Blisters and dead black toenails are a real concern.</p>\n<p>On top of that, you&#8217;re battling your metabolism. The human body can store about 45 minutes worth of glycogen, you&#8217;re sweating electrolytes, and generally depleting all your resources. In a 4 hour race, you&#8217;re gonna have to eat stuff, replenish your electrolytes to avoid cramping, and hope that you finish before your body says, <em>&#8220;You know what, screw this. I stop now.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>According to my FitBit, I burned 3263 calories. On a chill day with no exercise I burn 1800. That&#8217;s two days worth of calories gone in 4 hours. üò¨</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7723\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fitbit-screenshot.png\" width=\"2294\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fitbit-screenshot.png 2294w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fitbit-screenshot-300x134.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fitbit-screenshot-768x343.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/fitbit-screenshot-1024x457.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2294px) 100vw, 2294px\" />\n<p>My heart suffered, too. Average heart rate through the run was over 160, with peaks reaching up to 185.</p>\n<p>You thought marathons were about endurance? Ha! I spent 0% in the endurance heart rate.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7724\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heartrate-screenshot.png\" width=\"1002\" height=\"478\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heartrate-screenshot.png 1002w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heartrate-screenshot-300x143.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/heartrate-screenshot-768x366.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px\" />\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know all of this 3 years ago, but I did know that joints would be the problem. You can train cardio, but how do you teach your skeleton to withstand that sort of abuse?</p>\n<p>So I devised a plan that I&#8217;ve been following ever since: at least 2 &#8220;short&#8221; runs during the week, 1 long run on the weekend.</p>\n<p>At firs,t this meant two 5k runs during the week, then a 10k on the weekend. With time, this grew to two 8ks and a 15k on the weekend.</p>\n<p>That got me to a sub-2 hour marathon at the 2015 San Francisco Marathon, somewhere around 1:59:xx. Great job, Swiz!</p>\n<p>Then I started training for a marathon. I was going to run in Ljubljana that October, but was unable to leave the United States due to visa issues. There was a real chance I wouldn&#8217;t be able to come back.</p>\n<p>So I kept adding 2km to my Sunday runs, eventually making it all the way to 42km. Without race support and with far too many hills, I did it in 4:25:xx. A far cry from sub 4 hours, but a good lesson.</p>\n<p>I learned that a marathon is just a logistics race. You keep moving and you eat your gels and drink your water and tend to your electrolytes. Sometimes you poop.</p>\n<p>Best to poop before a run. Public restrooms are icky.</p>\n<p>With the October marathon in Ljubljana falling through, I slumped back into a loose routine of running twice a week for 8km to 10km, and a half marathon most Sundays.</p>\n<p>I knew what it took to ramp up and kept my baseline high.</p>\n<p>I ramped back up for the 2016 San Francisco Marathon. By now, I knew that having race support cuts up to 30 minutes from my time. I knew how to handle gels, and I had trained my metabolism to go through enormous piles of food to aid recovery.</p>\n<p>My routine was still two 10ks during the week, 1 half marathon or more during the weekend. But I started adding sprints to those 10ks and, ramping up to the marathon, I added 2 more weekday runs.</p>\n<p>The last two weeks before the race, I was running 5 10ks per week and 1 long run on Sunday. I was exhausted, and my practice marathon (two weeks out) was around 4:20.</p>\n<p>That seemed sufficient, so I rested my body, and on race day, I got a time of 4:02:xx. Two minutes too slow! UGH!</p>\n<p>So I had to do it again. Still not under 4 hours.</p>\n<p>My approach from then on was more lackadaisical. Two 10ks per week, 1 half marathon or more on Sunday. Some Sundays, I ran 16km; some Sundays, I ran 28km. Often it fell somewhere between 23 and 26 kilometers.</p>\n<p>Just enough to get to the Golden Gate Bridge and back. Nice views over there and watching surfers under the bridge is always fun.</p>\n<p>My runs weren&#8217;t taken super seriously. I would stop and I would smell the roses. Listen to podcasts, casually take interesting pictures. Stuff like that.</p>\n<p>I started ramping up about 2 months before the marathon. The longest I made it was 37km of a trail run. Casually took me 4 hours because trails are hard.</p>\n<p>But right before the marathon, the last three weeks, I was running 7 days a week, 12km with sprints. My pace was looking good, and my recovery times were great. Question was, can I keep it up on race day?</p>\n<p>I rested my body, no exercise, for 4 days before the race.</p>\n<p>And that seems to have done it. I ran the first half in 1:45:xx which gave me 30 minutes to faff around should anything happen. Stuff did happen. I broke down going up hills. I had to stop to take a shit. The last 2 kilometers, I was cramping up so hard I couldn&#8217;t run for more than 500 meters at a time.</p>\n<p>Finishing time? 3:47:35</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aedff1e8-356f-5311-80df-8a6064548034"}}
