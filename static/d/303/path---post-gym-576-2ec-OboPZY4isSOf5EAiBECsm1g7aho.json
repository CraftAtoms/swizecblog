{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Gym","content":"<p>\n Today I finally managed going to the gym after almost a week of not being able to attend my daily sessions due to insane work hours. Since I&#39;ve begun going this was the longest period of not going and it was quite an odd feeling. I felt weak and powerless, but at the same time didn&#39;t get as tired as I usually do, which, in a way, is good, but maybe it just shows that I was slacking off lest I hurt myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n I did almost manage to hurt myself when I was doing benchpresses where the left side didn&#39;t quite go into the resting position, but I still laxed my arms. Luckily the bar was long enough so as to hit the ground before breaking my face. If I wasn&#39;t in so much pain from lifting that thing I&#39;d probably get very very frightened by this event.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mentioned insane work hours didn&#39;t I? There&#39;s this project at work that needs immediate finishing, we only got it a week or so ago, and it required that I worked 12 hours a day on average for a few days including the weekend. If I was a proper employee this wouldn&#39;t be too bad, but for cthulhu&#39;s sake, I&#39;m technically doing this as a bloody part time job!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"90fdaaa6-2298-5c27-b9c5-abaa1a96766e"}}
