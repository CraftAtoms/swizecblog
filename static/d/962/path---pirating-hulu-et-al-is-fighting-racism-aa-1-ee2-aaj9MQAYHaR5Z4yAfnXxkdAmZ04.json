Seriously! Now I realise most of those say that they&#8217;re only doing this due to some sort of contractual obligations and are working desperately towards making a customer out of you.</p>\n<p>But you know what, the only ones I&#8217;ve ever seen actually <em>do </em>something about it were SouthParkStudios &#8211; and that makes them supercool in my book. I don&#8217;t pirate South Park anymore because of that.</p>\n<p>The main reason why these sort of <strong>regional copyright practices are bloody racist</strong> is that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8220;Those other countries aren&#8217;t worthy of paying for our content&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Oh those other people can watch shows <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Broadcast syndication\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadcast_syndication\">syndicated</a> two years behind the curve when all the jokes are stale and all event references are long gone&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Our business model is so outdated we need to create <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Artificial scarcity\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_scarcity\">artificial scarcity</a> to keep it up&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And all of these racist presumptions they make are due simply to the fact the &#8220;majors&#8221; still haven&#8217;t figured out that with the advent of the internets there is no notion of country for what is essentially information. <strong>We&#8217;re all citizens of the same world!</strong></p>\n<p>So I implore you dear reader, pirate, pirate and pirate some more everything and anything that they feel you are unworthy of being sold. And then pirate it some more!</p>\n<p>PS: please send this link onward if you agree, but especially if you don&#8217;t.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/c49d63bf-a4ba-4684-a240-f2af67839c47/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=c49d63bf-a4ba-4684-a240-f2af67839c47\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"22a60ef9-aeb9-5289-bec1-6c29a8cbfb79"}}
