It was great ☺️</p>\n<p>I dipped my toes in React Native and got some help from @nashio and @blackburn1911. They&#39;ve done it before or had better luck with Google. Both?</p>\n<p>We built a Hello World app that lets you browse through 6 of my Instagram photos. Tap on the right to go <em>next</em>, tap on the left to go <em>previous</em>.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7379\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/my-first-react-native-app-4.gif\" width=\"629\" height=\"807\" />\n<p>Sure, it would be more intuitive to swipe, but Snapchat uses taps for going back and forth in stories, and that&#39;s my excuse. I also don&#39;t know how to make swipes.</p>\n<p>The funny thing about starting with React Native is that googling <code>react native</code> gives you two big results. <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react-native/\">The official documentation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reactnative.com/\">reactnative.com</a>.</p>\n<p>I clicked reactnative.com and got confused immediately.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7377\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/reactnative.com-screenshot-2.png\" width=\"1222\" height=\"753\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/reactnative.com-screenshot-2.png 1222w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/reactnative.com-screenshot-2-300x185.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/reactnative.com-screenshot-2-768x473.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/reactnative.com-screenshot-2-1024x631.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1222px) 100vw, 1222px\" />\n<p>Okay, the new release cadence is monthly. Great! But how do I start using this thing? What do I do next? How do I begin? Do I need Xcode? Can I develop in a normal editor? Should I download a specialized IDE? WHAT DO I DO?</p>\n<p>Then I tried the official docs.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7378\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/official-docs-screenshot-3.png\" width=\"1174\" height=\"700\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/official-docs-screenshot-3.png 1174w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/official-docs-screenshot-3-300x179.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/official-docs-screenshot-3-768x458.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/official-docs-screenshot-3-1024x611.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1174px) 100vw, 1174px\" />\n<p><code>Get Started With React Native</code>. That looks promising!</p>\n<p>And boy, was it ever. Turns out™ you don&#39;t need much to start: <code>node</code>, <code>watchman</code>, and <code>react-native-cli</code>. Docs say <code>watchman</code> isn&#39;t mandatory, but it makes life better. ¯\\<em>(ツ)_/¯</em></p>\n<p>You need Xcode for the iOS simulator. If you&#39;re doing Android, you&#39;ll need that simulator, too.</p>\n<p>Then you run <code>react-native init NativeHelloWorld</code>, and it creates a bunch of things that I don&#39;t understand. When you run the simulator with <code>react-native run-ios</code>, a simulator shows up with your new app.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7375\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/initial-simulator-screenshot-1.png\" width=\"751\" height=\"1355\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/initial-simulator-screenshot-1.png 751w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/initial-simulator-screenshot-1-166x300.png 166w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/initial-simulator-screenshot-1-568x1024.png 568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 751px) 100vw, 751px\" />\n<p>Simulators, it turns out, are huge. Even on my big fat Apple Thunderbolt display. Maybe I should get one of those new 4K monsters ?</p>\n<p>Running <code>react-native run-ios</code> also opens a terminal with something called React Packager. Don&#39;t know what it is, but it looks necessary. I assume it&#39;s a compiler.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7376\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/react-packager-screnshot-1.png\" width=\"810\" height=\"420\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/react-packager-screnshot-1.png 810w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/react-packager-screnshot-1-300x156.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/react-packager-screnshot-1-768x398.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px\" />\n<p>Poking around the React Native API was fun, and we learned a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There&#39;s no <code>onClick</code>. To detect tap events, you should wrap components in <code>TouchableHighlight</code>, which takes one and only one child element. I think this is silly.</li>\n<li>Styling happens through the <code>style=</code> prop. There&#39;s no CSS. Or at least the project initiating script heavily promotes avoiding stylesheets.</li>\n<li>Layouting through Flexbox is encouraged. I assume you can do whatever you want, and Flexbox is the Best Practice™.</li>\n<li>If you use hot loading and add <code>state</code>, you have to reload the app. Otherwise, <code>render()</code> gets called without <code>state</code> getting initialized. That was a fun gotcha.</li>\n<li>Images don&#39;t size themselves. Without sizing, they&#39;re invisible.</li>\n<li>Debugging happens in a browser window, not the simulator. This feels funny.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Overall, I&#39;m impressed with how easy it was to get started. If you know React, you should be able to build cool stuff.</p>\n<p>Now we’ve just gotta figure out why <code>index.android.js</code> is separate from <code>index.ios.js</code>, learn more mobile development principles, then get an interesting project to poke at.</p>\n<p>Ideas?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6fe27fc3-4801-53b6-a758-9a44258ba91d"}}
