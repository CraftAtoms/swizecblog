Time for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_optimization\">stochastic search algorithms</a>! \\o/ My favorite and nerdiest way to think about life.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re you, and you want to have the best life you can. You don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re looking for, and you don&#8217;t know how to get there. You think you&#8217;ll recognize &#8220;best life&#8221; once you&#8217;re there. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill\">Psychology says that you won&#8217;t</a>.</p>\n<p>Your life is an optimization problem. You pick a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function\">fitness function</a> and search for the combination of inputs that returns the highest result – the global maximum.</p>\n<p>Your fitness function can be anything from <em>&#8220;How much $$ I&#8217;m making&#8221;</em> to <em>&#8220;How happy do I feel on average&#8221;</em>. Often, it&#8217;s a combination of things. People often have a function called &#8220;career&#8221;, another called &#8220;family&#8221;, and still another called &#8220;health&#8221;.</p>\n<p>YMMV</p>\n<h2>Pick a direction</h2>\n<p>In the beginning, you know nothing about the world, the problem you&#8217;re solving, or the destination. Any direction will do as long as you&#8217;re not standing still.</p>\n<h2>Listen to people you care about</h2>\n<p>Use your fitness function to see if your direction is correct.</p>\n<p>A good proxy is talking to the people you care about. Users and customers will tell you if you&#8217;re making things better or worse and what they want or need. Your friends, your family, and your gut will tell you if you&#8217;re becoming a better person.</p>\n<p>Trust your gut.</p>\n<h2>Adjust course</h2>\n<p>If people keep asking you to do X, and you&#8217;re doing Y, try X. Your fitness function might improve quicker.</p>\n<p>Probes in random directions are a good way to find promising new directions.</p>\n<h2>Do the work</h2>\n<p>Keep going.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t do the work, you don&#8217;t get the results. <strong>This is the most important step</strong>.</p>\n<p>You start with huge steps, then make your steps smaller and smaller as you approach the optimum. Otherwise, you might overshoot the peak.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7195\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/giphy-2.gif\" alt=\"giphy-2\" />\n<h2>Repeat until success</h2>\n<p>This is an iterative algorithm. The more iterations you perform, the closer to optimum you&#8217;ll get.</p>\n<p>When you find <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima\"><em>an</em> optimum</a>, and there are many, you can shake things up and try finding a better optimum.</p>\n<p>Starting again from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest\">a random location</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method\">trying random things</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing\">taking a few large steps</a> should knock you out of a local optimum and get you back on the path towards the global optimum.</p>\n<p>How fast you get to optimum, and how high it is, depends on factors largely outside your control: luck in picking your initial direction, fortune of circumstance and ability, &#8220;life events&#8221;, and macroeconomic trends.</p>\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a545a1aa-da40-5a6c-a893-a0fc4bb83089"}}
