Really cool of him to let me borrow it for a week, two, three!</p>\n<p>Today I survived my first ride from college to home and I have to say despite nearly getting mowed down by a car a couple of times and some bruised pedestrians it went pretty well. Those things are super fun and if I can get a hang of it I might buy one of my own instead of a set of rollerblades, because it means I wouldn&#8217;t have to keep lugging my shoes around &#8230; we&#8217;ll see, rollerblading is kind of super fun though &#8230;</p>\n<p>Oh and today I discovered that I flunked one too many exams, this likely means I won&#8217;t be able to get into the next year of my course and instead of being just before graduating from a masters equivalent in a year, I will be graduating from a bachelors in computer science.</p>\n<p>But this isn&#8217;t over yet, school system! I won&#8217;t go down without a fight!</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1052107--army-of-skateboarders-takes-over-downtown-streets\">Army of skateboarders takes over downtown streets</a> (thestar.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/article/1025357--longboarder-hit-by-car-seriously-injured\">Longboarder hit by car, seriously injured</a> (thestar.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://trueslant.com/caitlinkelly/2010/07/21/longboarding-takes-off-while-b-c-mourns-28-year-old-competitor-killed-last-week/\">Longboarding Takes Off &#8212; While B.C.
