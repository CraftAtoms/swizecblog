No way for a man to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Code\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">code</a>. Or a woman. Or anyone really. If I had a child, this would be how I ground them &#8211; restrict <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Text editor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">text editor</a> access to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Skype\" href=\"http://skype.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Skype</a>.</p>\n<p>Why was I doing this all day you ask?</p>\n<p>A few days ago I decided to launch a small experiment &#8211; for this I needed a small icon. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups\" target=\"_blank\">@ponywithhiccups</a> bravely stepped up to the task and got to work.</p>\n<p>After some days of back and forth we came up with a design both can be happy with. Bit of advice: <em>meet up in person</em> if at all possible. Especially for design.</p>\n<p>Then I asked her to code it all up in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">CSS</a> and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">HTML</a>. You know, because I&#8217;m lazy and she can totally handle that and I have far less important things to do than implementing my own experiments.</p>\n<p>With a huff and a puff she got to work.</p>\n<p>Everything was going <em>so well.</em> Right up to the point she finally decided she has no idea what&#8217;s going on and I should step in to help. Via Skype.</p>\n<p>Very well then, how hard can it be to lend a helping hand in coding some CSS? CSS is, like, totally child&#8217;s play. I can write CSS in my sleep!</p>\n<p>Turns out, via Skype, not so much.</p>\n<h2>Human = text editor</h2>\n<p>Perhaps the problem wasn&#8217;t Skype so much as it was <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pair programming\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">pair programming</a> to use another <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Human\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">human being</a>as a text editor. The only real issue Skype introduced was making the screen blurry and occasionally locking up so I could only see changes with a slight delay.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pair_programming_1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Look! It's paired programming!\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/Pair_programming_1.jpg/300px-Pair_programming_1.jpg\" alt=\"Look! It's paired programming!\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Look! It&#39;s paired programming! (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>\n<p>Using another human as a text editor, though, that was just painful.</p>\n<p>The way I work is very messy -&gt; I jump around the screen, scroll up and down, add a dot on line 10, write a row at line 100, refresh the browser, change some HTML, look at twitter, refresh the browser, change line 50, remove lines 10-20, add 5 lines, move the 5 lines fifty lines up.</p>\n<p>And so on.</p>\n<p>This works because I can keep the whole codebase in memory. But it&#8217;s <em>vital </em>that jumping around the file happens as quickly as it does in my head. Any delay feels like somebody was dragging a barbed wire through my brain while pulling the handbrake on my thoughts and chugging a refrigerator out the window.</p>\n<p>You know, that feeling you get when you&#8217;re trying to code, but the computer is being slow?</p>\n<p>Multiply it by 10 and add the computer asking <em>&#8220;Uh, what do you mean?&#8221; &#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</em> and every now and then <em>&#8220;OH! I know what you are going to say in 25 seconds!&#8221;</em> &#8230; and then doing the wrong thing.</p>\n<p>No fault to @ponywithhiccups of course, she&#8217;s just starting out with this stuff and I should have gone to her in person &#8211; we&#8217;d be done in half the time.</p>\n<p>Pointing at the screen with your finger and saying <em>&#8220;Right there, just fix that!&#8221;</em> doesn&#8217;t work either.</p>\n<p>BUT! In the end we prevailed and that&#8217;s <strong><em>awesome</em></strong>. I also learned a bunch about css3 animations; that stuff is fascinating. The things you can do, wow.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/webdevs-you-have-no-idea-how-much-you-know/swizec/3891\" target=\"_blank\">Webdevs, you have no idea how much you know</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.impressivewebs.com/css-the-good-parts/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS: The Good Parts</a> (impressivewebs.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://webdesigndevelopment11.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/website-development-with-html-5-and-css-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Website development with HTML 5 and CSS 3</a> (webdesigndevelopment11.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-57424441-233/skype-upgrades-interface-adds-touch-screen-features/?part=rss&amp;subj=news\" target=\"_blank\">Skype upgrades interface, adds touch-screen features</a> (reviews.cnet.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://mikeliving.wordpress.com/2012/05/01/web-design-and-hucksterism/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Design and Hucksterism</a> (mikeliving.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://itechtunes.com/2012/05/01/15-great-html5-and-css3-generators/\" target=\"_blank\">15 great HTML5 and CSS3 generators</a> (itechtunes.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=a623ba8a-2999-4b31-9f23-cad1a4f51768\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"98a7c2c1-a313-54ec-b0a3-85fbe54e7040"}}
