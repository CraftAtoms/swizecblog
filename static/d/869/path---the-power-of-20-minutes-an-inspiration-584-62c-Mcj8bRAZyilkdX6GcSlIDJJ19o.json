There&#8217;s a pile of books on my desk, all shiny and new, but unfortunately barely even leafed through. Just waiting patiently and asking me to please give them a read, are they bad books, perhaps they&#8217;re too fat? No you&#8217;re not fat book honey, I&#8217;m just busy.</p>\n<p>Two days ago I said, fuck it, this situation needs to be resolved, I used to read a lot, I love reading, so what&#8217;s the problem?</p>\n<p>As it turns out the problem is that starting is hard, isn&#8217;t that always the problem? Beginnings are always hard, sometimes it&#8217;s hard even to start going to bed or, hell, start having sex (and I don&#8217;t mean when you&#8217;re a virgin, I mean on a daily basis). But there was this other problem, I still didn&#8217;t have a lot of time.</p>\n<p>And so I came up with the concept of <strong>20 minutes a day</strong>. Twenty minutes might seem like a lot of time at first, but think about it. 20 minutes is the kind of time you waste walking to school, going to the post office, hell, just waiting for <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Risotto\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risotto\">risotto</a> to cook takes around 20 minutes. It&#8217;s NOTHING!</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Everyone&#8217;s got 20 minutes of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Leisure\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure\">free time</a> in any given day.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p><em>Yeah so everyone&#8217;s got twenty minutes, obviously that&#8217;s so little time you can&#8217;t do anything with it. </em>WRONG! You absolutely positively <em>can</em> do a lot of valuable stuff with that time. For instance you could read ten pages of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Charles Dickens\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens\">Dickens</a>, yes Dickens of all things, it reads slow, but in 20 minutes a lot can be done. Or you could devote 20 minutes of unadulterated attention to your children if you&#8217;ve got any, or your pets. Or you could spend the 20 minutes getting through your <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"RSS\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS feeds</a> (it&#8217;s doable), or do some Pilates like you&#8217;ve been wanting to for years.</p>\n<p>The thing is you just gotta get off your fucking lazy arse and DO IT! Go on, take 20 minutes out of your busy day and do something for yourself.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/8cbcf747-ac87-400c-8e76-d70abfbf6ece/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=8cbcf747-ac87-400c-8e76-d70abfbf6ece\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"57337494-6ea7-5e9a-ae83-713a0d9d9bb7"}}
