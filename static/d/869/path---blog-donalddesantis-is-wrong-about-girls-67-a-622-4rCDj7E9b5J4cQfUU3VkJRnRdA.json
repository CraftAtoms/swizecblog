Seriously, what are you doing standing around at a tech/entrepreneur conference not having epic chats with cool people? Don&#8217;t be silly.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 283px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jude_Law_as_Dan%28Closer%29.jpg\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Jude Law as Dan(Closer)\" src=\"\" alt=\"Jude Law as Dan(Closer)\" width=\"273\" height=\"399\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<p>He ties the advice with his experience of picking up cute women in public situations. The basic premise is <em>just do it</em>. But I think he&#8217;s wrong about girls.</p>\n<p><em>The rest of this post is completely my personal experience as a geek and a nerd who finds public situations to be draining and just plain difficult, but does it anyway. Your mileage may vary.</em></p>\n<p>Donald  says his revelation came when he suddenly realized that his &#8220;game&#8221; of standing around at bars, waiting for women to start talking to him wasn&#8217;t working <em>at all</em>. Here&#8217;s the thing though, if you go to a bar and just sort of stand around &#8230; girls will come talk to you. In fact this will happen more than once a night.</p>\n<p><em>Especially</em> if you look like you&#8217;re having fun on your own and are totally content with yourself. I think it irks them that there is this guy who isn&#8217;t paying attention to their &#8220;come talk to me&#8221; vibes. So they come talk to you instead.</p>\n<p>Further on Donald lists three traits guys think they need to get girls:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Be a great dancer (tech corollary: slick demo/pitch)</em></p>\n<p><em>Surround yourself with a coterie of other attractive women (tech corollary: a coterie of other investors or “cool kids”)</em></p>\n<p><em>Have charm like <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hugh Grant\" href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/hugh_grant\" rel=\"rottentomatoes\">Hugh Grant</a>, with a face like <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Jude Law\" href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/jude_law\" rel=\"rottentomatoes\">Jude Law</a> (tech corollary: Have charm like Hugh Grant, with a face like Jude Law)</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, you don&#8217;t need to know how to dance. If you just go out there and <em>dance like nobody&#8217;s watching</em>. Girls will come dance with you. Tried and proven. You don&#8217;t even have to know what you&#8217;re doing, you just have to be comfortable with yourself.</p>\n<p>Surrounding yourself with girls, unfortunately, does not work at all. I&#8217;m often out with a group of female friends and, without fault, on those nights not a single girl comes talk to me. They usually just assume I&#8217;m taken or otherwise reserved for the night.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t do that.</p>\n<p>Being charming like Hugh Grant or sexy like Jude Law definitely helps with being a heart-throb, but girls look for average (evolution etc.). You know how hotties look intimidating to you and like you could never get them since they&#8217;re way out of your league? Yeah, that&#8217;s how girls feel about Jude Law.</p>\n<p>Not a good strategy at all. Just be charming enough not to step on too many toes and remember to smile. It works wonders &#8230; especially once you cross a line or ten. Smiling and being nice about it smooths everything over.</p>\n<p>Donald also says that getting girls&#8217; numbers is apparently Hard Business &#8482;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I didn’t get the first phone number I asked for, nor the second. In fact, the first number probably came somewhere between tries five and ten. But with each rejection, beliefs #1 and #2 became less false. I also become much more comfortable at getting a conversation rolling. Mastery through repetition.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I have so far gotten every single phone number I actually <em>asked for</em>. Turns out people find it really really difficult to turn down polite requests. If you ask for something nicely, you will get it almost without fault.</p>\n<p>Just be nice, don&#8217;t look creepy and never ask for a number right off the cuff. Chances are the girl won&#8217;t think twice about giving it to you. Why would she? Here&#8217;s a nice guy making a polite request, she has no reason to turn you down. Especially if you promise to call her about something friendly &#8230; had a cool conversation about something she&#8217;s good at? Get her number in case you ever need an expert on hand.</p>\n<p>Works every time.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s very very important that you <em>actually ask</em>. Being a geek and a nerd I usually forget this part. Hell, I&#8217;ve had people chasing after me because I will just wander off in the middle of a cool conversation without asking for a phone number. It&#8217;s unfortunate when that happens with a hottie (and it does happen, except they don&#8217;t chase after you but stand there baffled and confused).</p>\n<p>Mostly the whole thing is really easy. Relax, talk like you&#8217;re talking to a long lost friend, give them a way to help you, be nice and avoid being generic like it&#8217;s the plague.</p>\n<p>PS: before you think I&#8217;m super successful with the ladies, I&#8217;m not, I usually end up friendzoning them because I forget that they might like me. There were even occasions where I had a girl in my room and the thought she might like me never even crossed my mind.</p>\n<p>PPS: the standing around minding your own business play works so well girls will sometimes ask <em>you</em> for <em>your</em> number.</p>\n<div class=\"mceTemp\"></div>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.geekwire.com/2011/hopelessly-single-taught-pitching-tech-celebs\">What being hopelessly single taught me about pitching tech Celebs</a> (geekwire.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://katiebman.wordpress.com/2011/11/05/being-wrong/\">Being Wrong</a> (katiebman.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.tbseblog.com/2011/11/02/the-best-pickup-line-ever/\">The Best Pickup Line Ever.</a> (tbseblog.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=c96c2d1c-fd76-4689-9f9b-3a3d8d4d31dd\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"19aebe4e-716c-5460-a787-e88342548776"}}
