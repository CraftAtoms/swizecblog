Remember how a few years ago we had to kill all the muslims?</p>\n<p>I went to see the protesters today and I have to say the whole thing seems rather strange.</p>\n<p>First of all, they were marching behind a very popular song <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%28You_Gotta%29_Fight_for_Your_Right_%28To_Party%21%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Fight For Your Right</a> by the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Beastie Boys\" href=\"http://www.beastieboys.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Beastie Boys</a>, which undoubtedly brought millions if not billions of pure profits to the license holders &#8230; most likely a huge record label.</p>\n<p>Most of the protesters were also taking photos with their iphones, wearing clothes made affordable by cheap production in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Sweatshop\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweatshop\" rel=\"wikipedia\">sweat shops</a> of China and using twitter and facebook to communicate &#8230; you know two very capitalistically inclined startups.</p>\n<p>How much is facebook worth again?</p>\n<p>Oh and they were using roads made possible by a long history of &#8220;exploitation&#8221;. The whole thing reminds me a lot of this particular <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Monty Python\" href=\"http://www.pythonline.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Monty Python</a> skit:</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ExWfh6sGyso\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>Actually, there&#8217;s another relevant video you should watch. It&#8217;s about how The Noob Effect has ruined videogames. Mostly it speaks how pandering to the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lowest common denominator\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_denominator\" rel=\"wikipedia\">lowest common denominator</a> will eventually ruin everything.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/n7VAhzPcZ-s\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"420\" height=\"315\"></iframe></p>\n<p>I think this is what the ribble rabble are trying to do right now. They want the economy as a whole to pander to the lowest common denominator &#8211; a social sciences graduate with no skills beyond serving tables at the local coffee shop.</p>\n<p>The Noob Effect has already happened to our videogames, movies, music, blogs, literature &#8230; hell, even food and education. How about we not let the same happen to, you know, <em>the fucking core of our freaking society?</em></p>\n<p>Just play the damn game and stop trying to ruin it for everybody else!</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=65c7a642-d754-4b12-b0f1-ce8c16873baf\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"537592c7-35e6-5338-b5f4-028d39e15736"}}
