{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Battlestar Galactica &#8211; best video novel ever","content":"<p>Over the past few months, difficult to say just how many, I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Battlestar Galactica\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/\">Battlestar Galactica</a> on my computer. Seems when I finally found out about this marvelous show I had a good three years of catching up to do and let me tell you something. It. Was. Worth. It!<br />\n<img class=\"alignright\" title=\"Cylon number six\" src=\"http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/threadcount/cylon6.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"303\" height=\"376\" /><br />\nSeriously, Battlestar Galactica is the best television series in all history of television series, it&#8217;s better even than <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"The Big Bang Theory\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://alpha.cbs.com/primetime/big_bang_theory/\">The Big Bang Theory</a>, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"House (TV series)\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_%28TV_series%29\">House MD</a> and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"MacGyver\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGyver\">McGyver</a>. MUCH better! What really sets this show apart is that it&#8217;s not classically American in that it doesn&#8217;t rely on dashingly good looking actors, cheap humor or anything that makes television the crap that it is.</p>\n<p>To be honest, most of Galactica&#8217;s actors are rather averageÂ  looking (except for the cylon babes of course), nothing you wouldn&#8217;t find in an average gym, especially the pilots and other military personel. Sure they&#8217;re well built and whatnot, but they aren&#8217;t dashingly good looking. Even the humor is, surprise surprise, human. Never feels written, never feels repetitive and boring, just looks like plain and simple everyday arsing around.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not really what I love about Battlestar Galactica. What I REALLY love is the story. The story is fucking brilliant. Humans have a war with the Cylons, their creations with an overly developed sense of enslavement, their planets get nuked into oblivion and those who by some odd chance survive &#8230; leave in search of earth.</p>\n<p>The brilliance here is that we&#8217;re actually only a few decades away from something like that happening on our own planet! And what&#8217;s more, in the series finale, after many somewhat predictable twists and turns we find out that the story isn&#8217;t that of a future. Not even that of a future reimagined and change in a few terms to make it seem like fiction. Oh no, it&#8217;s the story of our history. Everything, absolutely everything, we see on the show culminates in the humans landing on our Earth 150 <em>thousand</em> years ago and starting anew with the tribal humans already on the planet.</p>\n<p>Now the interesting bit here is how nicely all of this ties up with factual history. Fact is, we know humans on earth at some point made a huge fucking jump from hunter-gatherer tribes to building pyramids and having large-scale civilizations. This of course hasn&#8217;t happened 150k years ago, but still, astounding stuff.</p>\n<p>All I want to know after watching this marvelous show start to end is where can I buy this novel in book form? I want to read this thing as a book.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Zemified by Zemanta\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/b32d328f-b889-45d5-acd3-a7ff873b122c/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=b32d328f-b889-45d5-acd3-a7ff873b122c\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2a8648b7-a24f-5cc6-a892-d2be4d542fd7"}}
