{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"A talk that changes everything","content":"<p>This talk by <a title=\"Bret Victor\" href=\"http://worrydream.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Bret Victor</a> has changed my entire perspective on programming and how I want to continue working in this field. It starts out a bit slow, but you <em>should</em> watch it. Well worth it, I promise.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/36579366?byline=0\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\"></iframe></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://vimeo.com/36579366\">Bret Victor &#8211; Inventing on Principle</a> from <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/cusec\">CUSEC</a> on <a href=\"http://vimeo.com\">Vimeo</a>.</p>\n<p>A quick recap of the more salient points for all you lazy bastards out there who aren&#8217;t willing to devote an hour of your time to expanding your horizons.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> To be creative, you need an immediate, direct connection to what you&#8217;re doing, none of that &#8220;several layers of abstraction on top of abstraction and thinking ten steps ahead to understand what&#8217;s going on&#8221; &#8230; why would you have to emulate a computer in your head when you have one right there?</p>\n<p><strong>2. </strong>When inventing new things, perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t be thinking about creating cool products or hacking the awesomest algorithm or even the most elegant design both in code and UX &#8211; perhaps we should find a principle and stick to it? Once you have that principle, everything else follows.</p>\n<p><strong>3. </strong>There are some <em>extremely</em> awesome demos in that talk. If nothing else, at least skip around to those &#8211; there&#8217;s an epic way to make games, an awesome way to create animations and a pretty cool way of visualizing what your algorithm does <em>as you write it</em>.</p>\n<p>There isn&#8217;t much more I can add to all this, just watch the video and be amazed. Now excuse me while I run off to find my principle.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/dd/2012/02/27/can-code-really-be-poetry/\">Can code really be poetry?</a> (thenextweb.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://gangsgoonsandgunz.rahrahrecords.com/articles/inventing-principle-video/\">Inventing on principle [Video]</a> (gangsgoonsandgunz.rahrahrecords.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://tatiyants.com/lipstick-on-a-pig-is-not-ux/\">Lipstick on a Pig is Not UX</a> (tatiyants.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://boingboing.net/2012/02/15/technology-interaction-and-eth.html\">Technology interaction and ethics: how to live a good life and make a better world</a> (boingboing.net)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=7ae8e756-035a-4e43-b841-fdc9eccdd3f9\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a05efc19-abc5-5c58-846a-13d649da0926"}}
