And you even use so much sense as to shorten everything up by just multiplying the sum of all probabilities with 2! (essentiall 2*1)</p>\n<p>Yep, I actually wrote out two whole members of the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Summation\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation\" rel=\"wikipedia\">summation</a> series before realizing what I was doing &#8230;</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that I actually did write down that <a title=\"I learned two things today 4.8.\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-4-8/swizec/2357\">thing I said yesterday I didn&#8217;t write down</a>, but forgot I had written it down. What I had learned yesterday was that levenshtein distance and hamming distance are pretty similar beasts. The first is a measure of the number of changes you need to perform to turn a string into a different string, whereas the latter is only about the number of substitutions to be performed.</p>\n<p>And yes, that passes for super interesting these days.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://wpgaurav.wordpress.com/2011/08/31/do-you-multiply-this-way/\">Do you multiply this way!</a> (wpgaurav.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://awakeninspiration.wordpress.com/2011/07/26/writing-prompts-journaling/\">Writing prompts (Journaling).</a> (awakeninspiration.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://aplaceforwriters.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/8-things-ive-learned-about-writing/\">8 Things I&#8217;ve Learned About Writing</a> (aplaceforwriters.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://auroramorealist.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/random-things-about-me/\">10 Random Things About Me</a> (auroramorealist.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=7127d305-00c3-475d-b340-94e684fc6779\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"29a44707-7daa-5e17-994f-928f1a510058"}}
