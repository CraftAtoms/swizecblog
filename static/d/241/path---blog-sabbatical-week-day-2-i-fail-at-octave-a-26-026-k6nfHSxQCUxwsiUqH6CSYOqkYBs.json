This week’s posts will serve as a sort of report of what I got up to the previous day instead of the usual schedule – wish me luck that I achieve even half of what I’d like to.</em></p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Programming_language_textbooks.jpg\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"English: A selection of programming language t...\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/300px-Programming_language_textbooks1.jpg\" alt=\"English: A selection of programming language t...\" width=\"300\" height=\"204\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p>After I managed to get the <a title=\"Sabbatical week day 1: Toshl and Toggl datasets\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/sabbatical-week-day-1-toshl-and-toggl-datasets/swizec/3277\">toggl and toshl datasets</a> on Monday it was time to do something useful with them yesterday. Turns out, I&#8217;m not very good at doing useful things with datasets because my biggest achievement of the day was coming up with a plot of the data.</p>\n<p>You know that all awesome <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Data\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data\" rel=\"wikipedia\">data format</a> that is <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"JSON\" href=\"http://json.org\" rel=\"homepage\">JSON</a>? Every <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Programming language\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language\" rel=\"wikipedia\">programming language</a> except Java has a nice and easy interface for loading and saving right into native <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Data structure\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure\" rel=\"wikipedia\">data structures</a>. This makes it perfect and all &#8217;round awesome! So it seemed only natural that my node.js scripts for fetching data would be storing it in JSON for future use.</p>\n<p>Or so I thought.</p>\n<p>If there is one thing I learned in <a href=\"http://ml-class.com\">ml-class</a> it&#8217;s that one should always take some time to first model their <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Machine learning\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning\" rel=\"wikipedia\">machine learning algorithm</a> in a mathematical language like matlab/octave before implementing in a production-like language. Something about how all those <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Matrix (mathematics)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_%28mathematics%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\">matrix operations</a> are easier and how having a language created especially for the task makes it all that easier to play around.</p>\n<p>I guess octave is to machine learning as <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adobe InDesign\" href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html\" rel=\"homepage\">InDesign</a> or Illustrator are to web design?</p>\n<p>Turns out not only doesn&#8217;t <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"GNU Octave\" href=\"http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/\" rel=\"homepage\">Octave</a> have a native way of reading JSON, but even when you find a library it is <em>impossible</em> to say <em>Here is a file, make it a string yo!</em> Just doesn&#8217;t work. All files need to have a format or something &#8230; it&#8217;s really quite silly.</p>\n<p>Luckily there was a simple solution &#8211; just dump the data as a column of numbers and Octave couldn&#8217;t have been happier about it.</p>\n<p>As mentioned, I didn&#8217;t get very far, this graph is the extent of my achievements yesterday:</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3283\" style=\"width: 727px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_046.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3283 \" title=\"Toshl and Toggl plotted\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_046-1024x345.png\" alt=\"Toshl and Toggl plotted\" width=\"717\" height=\"241\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_046-1024x345.png 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_046-300x101.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Selection_046.png 1227w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Toshl and Toggl plotted</p></div>\n<p>Just for fun I tried running linear regression on this data and, as expected, it failed horribly. The lowest cost is a function along the lines of <em>y = </em><em>-6.5541e+88*x + </em><em> -4.8840e+90</em> &#8230; I&#8217;m not even sure coming up with fake-ish quadratic and cubic function elements would do much good in this case and since I only have a single parameter neural networks wouldn&#8217;t do much good either.</p>\n<p>And either way, anything that comes even close to modeling this data will suffer from horrible overfitting and won&#8217;t be much use anyway &#8230; luckily I have some other ideas I can try.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/sabbatical-week-day-1-toshl-and-toggl-datasets/swizec/3277\">Sabbatical week day 1: Toshl and Toggl datasets</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.r-bloggers.com/visualizing-gestures-as-paths/\">Visualizing Gestures as Paths</a> (r-bloggers.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Why_is_a_harp_shaped_how_it_is\">Why is a harp shaped how it is</a> (wiki.answers.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7451757/octave-select-a-file\">Octave select a file?</a> (stackoverflow.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2011/11/plotting_a_density_map/\">Plotting a density map</a> (tablix.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://flowingmotion.jojordan.org/2011/10/16/12-steps-to-running-gradient-descent-in-octave/\">12 steps to running gradient descent in Octave</a> (flowingmotion.jojordan.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://flowingmotion.jojordan.org/2011/12/04/down-to-earth-principal-components-analysis-in-5-steps/\">Down-to-earth principal components analysis in 5 steps</a> (flowingmotion.jojordan.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=037d18ab-29b7-4c83-99e3-02ae84f3b1f3\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"939300c0-2916-5ec4-a304-ebd2950f1a22"}}
