Turns out it can actually happen. Just like Tom turns completely white when a train is rushing towards him, so too my face turned white when I was sitting in that damn chair. Nearly fainted too.</p>\n<p>I never did like dentists much &#8211; seven years since my last appointment after all &#8211; Â but to <em>nearly faint</em>Â from fear? Nausea, tunnel vision, white face; the whole shebang! Didn&#8217;t even feel that bad, but you know shit&#8217;s going down when the dentist removes your glasses &#8220;just in case&#8221; and puts a wet rag on your forehead.</p>\n<p>Lucky for me, I have magical teeth and the tally from all the years of neglect is just:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one broken filling</li>\n<li>three <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Wisdom tooth\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisdom_tooth\" rel=\"wikipedia\">wisdom teeth</a>Â with some caries</li>\n<li>inflamed gums</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of that <em>OMG my wisdom teeth are breaking my head and trying to destroy everything!!!</em>Â I honestly expected much worse, but hey, I&#8217;ll take the deal ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>It also turns out I suck at keeping my mouth open and will be having much fun the next time I visit &#8230;Â something about working on the back teeth and not being able to get the drill completely vertical and maybe not even being able to work on them &#8230;</p>\n<p>Now my face feels funny from the injection, the <em>optional</em>Â injection.Â Can&#8217;t imagine the amounts of pain there would be had I not told them that yes, yes I do want that injection thing. You did notice I almost fainted when you were just <em>cleaning</em>Â my teeth right? WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME THIS!?</p>\n<p>Those things take a while to really kick in. She was almost done drilling before I stopped feeling everything and even then just the air blowing over my teeth hurt like <em>hell.</em>Â Not to even mention the disinfectant.</p>\n<p>Another appointment in a few weeks and then I guess I&#8217;m good to go for another seven years.
