The idea is that you should make an effort for absolute focus when you&#8217;re working. That means no twitter, no browsing random websites, just take a task, focus on it 100% and plow right through until you&#8217;re done.</p>\n<p>Obviously you can&#8217;t do this for 8 hours a day unless you&#8217;re some sort of robot. Most people aren&#8217;t robots. Yet.</p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 1.3em;\">tl;dr &#8211;&gt; Pomodoro is great for productivity, bad for Klout scores</em></p>\n<p>Therefore pomodoro demands that you take a short break every 25 minutes, and a longer one every two hours. Apparently this is just enough to keep your brain fresh for plowing through tasks like a boss and <em>getting shit done</em>.</p>\n<p>I have to say I was a bit skeptical of the whole premise. I can&#8217;t work like that! I have a scatterbrain&#8217;s mind. My mind thinks in parallels rather than linearly. The internet has ruined my ability to focus! I don&#8217;t have 25 minutes of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Attention span\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span\">attention span</a>, are you fucking kidding me?</p>\n<p>But then I got busy. Workloads started piling up and my scattered approach just wasn&#8217;t working anymore. Even though it tends to work pretty well when you only have a project or two going on, it tended to fall apart when I had five projects I was working on in parallel. Thoughts started overflowing and my mind was just overloaded.<!--more--></p>\n<p>So I started trying out setting limits for myself. Rather than saying &#8220;I will work on this until it gets done, then I will work on that other thing&#8221; I just set up timeslots. Two hours for this, then no matter whether it&#8217;s done or not, the other thing for two hours.</p>\n<p>And so on ad infinitum.</p>\n<p>It worked pretty well, but I could notice myself getting burned out. Holding sufficient levels of focus for two hours is <em>hard</em>. Then I remembered this so called <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pomodoro Technique\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">Pomodoro</a> technique @gandalfar mentioned in passing one day. It seemed an awful lot like what I was doing was some sort of pomodoro anyway.</p>\n<p>Next step was to download a loud ticking pomodoro clock for my iPhone and start trying it out.</p>\n<p>It felt weird as hell!</p>\n<p>But I noticed a couple of things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The loud ticking acts as a milfy hot angry grade school teacher, tapping her ruler and looking at you going &#8220;Get to work maggot! Stop staring at my rack! WORK!&#8221;</li>\n<li>Taking short breaks when you&#8217;re in the flow is surprisingly hard</li>\n<li>The scheduled long breaks are pure <em>awesome</em></li>\n<li>Forcing yourself to take a break pays dividends at 2am when you&#8217;re still fresh as a rose and able to focus</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point I would like to admit that I sometimes don&#8217;t follow the ticking tomato as rigorously as I should. I often skip the short break because I&#8217;m on the verge of getting something done, and sometimes I take a break a couple of minutes early because I had just plowed through two pomodoro&#8217;s without taking a break. Also, the last pomodoro in a batch is usually starting to get a bit haywire and isn&#8217;t absolutely focused.</p>\n<p>However, despite all my flaws in following the technique, the past couple of weeks have been particularly good to me productivity-wise.</p>\n<p>I have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>finished two pretty large school projects with fantastic grades</li>\n<li>passed several exams with decent enough grades</li>\n<li>started and launched <a href=\"http://githubfriends.swizec.com\" target=\"_blank\">GithubFriends</a></li>\n<li>watched 132 episodes of How I Met Your Mother</li>\n<li>had the most fruitful freelancing month ever</li>\n<li>had an actual social life all throughout</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although, all the focus during pomodoros has had one very awful side-effect. My Klout score is experiencing massive drops:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 490px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Fluctuating like a boss\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/jLW0g4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"239\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fluctuating like a boss</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://linearfix.wordpress.com/2011/04/07/pomodoro-technique-improves-focus-with-a-timer/\">Pomodoro Technique Improves Focus with a Timer</a> (linearfix.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://alecthegeek.wordpress.com/category/work-practices/\">Work Practices &#8221; Alec the Geek</a> (alecthegeek.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://gigaom.com/collaboration/the-pomodoro-technique-another-option-for-getting-things-done-and-staying-focused/\">The Pomodoro Technique: A GTD Alternative?: Online Collaboration &#8220;</a> (gigaom.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://sse4m.wordpress.com/2011/05/14/the-pomodoro-technique/\">The Pomodoro Technique!</a> (sse4m.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=8c8eee0a-b959-4bcd-abd3-4a3f2cd9b336\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"34334ee4-d5d4-5547-ae21-7c16eb6b3ae1"}}
