Well I finally got fed up of waiting for the &quot;day or two&quot; to pass on Wednesday and decided to call them up and implore about what was going on. They say that tomorrow (Thursday) it&#39;d surely be done. No call. So on Friday I call again and they go that yeah yeah, it&#39;ll be done in a few hours and I should just come pick it up. No call.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo I called again and the mister told me that nope, computer is still all in parts on the operating table. This really put me down &#8230; but a few moments later the guy calls back and says that hey, he checked wrongly and the compuer was ready for pick up after all. Woot. (later on that day I got a similar surprise when the girlfriend said she was coming a <em>lot</em> sooner than I was expecting, a whole night sooner actually)\n</p>\n<p>\nVery well, got the computer and instantly had some issues with getting it to work, but nothing major, just seems that connecting my old batter DVD drive to power is a bit tricky. After some more issues I finally had ubuntu up and running and decided to give KDE 4.1 a go, and I did.\n</p>\n<p>\nYou know what, I really can&#39;t understand what everyone is complaining about because 4.1 is totally ready for day-to-day use. Sure it might still be bit buggy now and anon and some things aren&#39;t quite fully completed yet (I&#39;m looking at you Amarok!), but it&#39;s shangrilah compared to what Linux was when I first made the switch in roughly 2k2, back then we still had to mount cdroms and shit manually!\n</p>\n<p>\nBut because just the orgasmic prettiness of kde isn&#39;t enough I also took the liberty of setting up compiz and making everything even prettier. Ok so it&#39;s not <em>that</em> prettier and in some regards even uglier (this time I&#39;m looking at you old skool window decorations!), but it sure is faster and more responsive, to the point I believe I&#39;ll be running it full time.\n</p>\n<p>\nNow it&#39;s time to go learn how to code those widgets because I&#39;m sick and tired of my tea timer being an actual application running in dock when it should be an awesome widget!</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e70b7d9f-b6d3-5797-b959-4ebcf34e07db"}}
