Bought one too many yesterday (it later turned out I didn&#8217;t buy too many, I just forgot my grandmother might like getting one) and offered on Facebook on Twitter to send the first person who gives me their address a postcard.</p>\n<p>Five people asked for one. So now that I was going to buy postcards anyway I asked for random people who might like a postcard and ended up having to buy fourteen of them. Well ok, three of those are for some cool professors <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zidarsk8\" target=\"_blank\">@zidarsk8</a> reminded me of.</p>\n<p>Point is, people love postcards still.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that in the US they have automated stamp dispensing machine. You just swipe a credit card, press a few buttons and ugly stamps come out. Quite an amazing system if you need stamps on a Sunday afternoon.</p>\n<p>PS: bonus thing I learned; wearing a bunny hat in Cheesecake Factory does not phase the waiters at all.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"43e51322-38af-5833-8d47-0ff306fe2af9"}}
