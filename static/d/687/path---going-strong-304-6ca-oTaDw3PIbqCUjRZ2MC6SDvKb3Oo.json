The nastiest of the endeavours was trying to get the page to display properly in different browsers and I managed to make it work in both FF and Opera, but it still doesn&#8217;t work quite well in IE and is downright nasty (although still useful) in konqueror.</p>\n<p>Cross-browser support is really strange, if you have a 400px wide image above a 400px wide div, somehow those two are of different widths by 2px in just about every browser save for Opera. This strikes me as severely odd, but it has a simple workaround&#8230; still seems rather silly.</p>\n<p>Wanted to make a placeholder instead of the first comic but didn&#8217;t quite get around to colouring it just yet, so it, and some banners, should most probably be put on the site sometime tomorow</font></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b9a76558-0e6d-59f7-8593-3b8814387533"}}
