You&#8217;re trying to help yourself remember? Solve your own problems. You can worry about theirs later. It also helps if you bitch to more than one person and a general <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/rule_of_thumb\" title=\"Rule of thumb\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thumb\">rule of thumb</a> you should likely follow is to bitch about stuff to people that can actually help.</p>\n<p>Let me Â outline four great things that can come out of bitching and you be the judge:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Teamwork</strong> &#8211; sharing encourages people to help</li>\n<li><strong>Understanding</strong> &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to do anything until you understand it, you don&#8217;t understand until you can explain</li>\n<li><strong>Focus</strong> &#8211; talking about crap forces you to think about crap, you can only do/solve what you think about</li>\n<li><strong>Appreciation</strong> &#8211; mums are the most underappreciated people in the world, it&#8217;s because nobody knows what it is exactly that they do</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There&#8217;s bound to be more, I just can&#8217;t think of them right now. Talk to anyone who has to manage developers and ask them whether they prefer the guys who buckle down at their desk and don&#8217;t say a word until a task is finished let it take an hour or a month &#8230; or the guy who keeps giving them progress reports, explains the pain points and so on?</p>\n<p>Hell, take good looking girls. Are most of them going home from parties with blabbermouths or that quiet guy who seems kinda cool, but not really all that human?</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a fan of <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/m/04p5cr\" title=\"House\" rel=\"myspace\" href=\"http://www.myspace.com/everything/house\">House MD</a>. Consider Chase and Foreman. The former gets all the girls, the latter is a robot everyone makes fun of for never showing any emotion.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not a vampire, being all dark and brooding doesn&#8217;t work for picking up chicks.</p>\n<p>Now I&#8217;m not advocating being one of those people who just bitch and moan and never do anything about it, that&#8217;s just being an annoying 13 year old girl. But you should really consider using bitching and moaning as a tool to better understanding the core issue at hand and finding a solution.</p>\n<p>Protip: you don&#8217;t even need a listener, just get it out there (twitter is great for this, nobody will care)</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/americas/navy-seal-osama-kill-team-told-to-stay-quiet/article2008168/\">Navy SEAL Osama kill team told to stay quiet</a> (theglobeandmail.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/03/navy-seals-the-quiet-professionals-got-bin-laden/\">Navy SEALs, the &#8216;quiet professionals,&#8217; got bin Laden</a> (ac360.blogs.cnn.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=f49bc749-3e2e-40b6-8655-01bc60a2c681\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4e4b2dd9-54b0-582a-9fdb-85e3ed0fd406"}}
