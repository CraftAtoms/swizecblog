As it shouldn&#8217;t be, we live in the future! Take a document, click print and voila, the magical elves in a plastic box do their magic and you get a lovely piece of paper with some crap on it.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/37996586299@N01/5059286742\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"trollface\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/5059286742_eb649aaae3_m5.jpg\" alt=\"trollface\" width=\"240\" height=\"219\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image by JimYounkin via Flickr</p></div>\n</div>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a box of elves of your own, you take it to the nearest person who does, pay them the price of a tenth of gum and they do it for you.</p>\n<p>But sometimes you want to do this in a more sophisticated manner. Perhaps your target <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Paper size\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_size\" rel=\"wikipedia\">paper size</a> isn&#8217;t A4, perhaps you&#8217;re doing something that can&#8217;t just be whisked up in your favourite Word clone. Maybe, just maybe, you aren&#8217;t producing the content, maybe you have a form somewhere on the interwebs that people can fill out.</p>\n<p>As I found out last night and this morning, that bit isn&#8217;t too simple.</p>\n<p>Last night I set out on the monumental task of preparing the second batch of <a href=\"http://postme.me\" target=\"_blank\">Postme.me&#8217;s</a> for printing. I was once told that everybody in the world uses something called <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adobe InDesign\" href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html\" rel=\"homepage\">InDesign</a> to do this, hell, I used it to set up the first batch.</p>\n<p>But it was 18 cards this time, that&#8217;s a bit much to do by hand isn&#8217;t it? <a title=\"Programmers are fucking lazy\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/programmers-are-fucking-lazy/swizec/2648\">I&#8217;m a lazy programmer</a> after all and my kind cowers before menial tasks like nobody&#8217;s business!</p>\n<p><em>I will automate this!,</em> I thought.</p>\n<p>The fuck I will.</p>\n<p>After spending five minutes getting the database to export as a shiny <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"XML\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML\" rel=\"wikipedia\">XML</a> I spent upwards of two hours trying to figure out how to convince InDesign to import said XML. Yes, it does haz the capabilities, no they don&#8217;t help &#8230; or maybe I just can&#8217;t think like a designer and that&#8217;s why nothing made sense.</p>\n<p>I mean come on, you tag all the fields, you get all the data to import and be properly tagged &#8230; but it just does not want to fill the template. It could at least help with the menial tasks. Nope, <em>Fuck you! I will reset all your fonts and colours to a magical default.</em> Problem?</p>\n<p>InDesign was trolling me on purpose, I swear!</p>\n<p>Oh but what&#8217;s this, browsers have a shiny print to PDF feature don&#8217;t they? Maybe I can just export as nice <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\" rel=\"wikipedia\">HTML</a> and get a browser to print it into a PDF and be done with it.</p>\n<p>Yeah, fuck that too. Turns out no matter how hard I tried it is virtually impossible to convince any browser to print without margins. Even setting up a custom paper size that explicitly defines zero margins &#8230; nope. The closest browser to come to cracking the problem was Chromium on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Linux\" href=\"http://www.kernel.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">Linux</a> &#8230; things only got screwy around page 15 &#8230; and only got worse henceforth.</p>\n<p>Chromium on Mac indeed has an actual working marginless feature. But it only supports A4 directly, use the OS&#8217;s print screen and the marginless feature magically vanishes, but you do get different paper sizes.</p>\n<p>And it only gets worse.</p>\n<p>Tried a number of different programs and libraries to export a piece of nicely formatted modern-ish HTML to PDF and nothing worked. Either the paper sizes were off (but the margins were alright) or the font didn&#8217;t render correctly.</p>\n<p>In the end, after at least five hours of trying different things, I broke down and did it by hand. Copy pasted all the images and all the text into an InDesign file &#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230; it took 20 minutes.</p>\n<p>Hat&#8217;s off to all the designers of the world who do this stuff on a daily basis.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://tc.eserver.org/38079.html\">A Web Developer&#8217;s Guide To Adobe InDesign</a> (tc.eserver.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ugliesttattoos.failblog.org/2011/10/23/funny-tattoos-trollface-approved/\">Trollface Approved</a> (ugliesttattoos.failblog.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://teenwebzine.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/featured-meme-rage-comic-memes/\">Featured Meme: Rage Comic Memes</a> (teenwebzine.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://thegreatflashbang.wordpress.com/2011/10/16/874/\">Trollface</a> (thegreatflashbang.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=38b6b8c0-faa8-4a03-8cc1-ecbcf3788301\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"12a82efc-8f69-5b67-8e0c-ce992a56e11f"}}
