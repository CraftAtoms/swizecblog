It&#8217;s not because we didn&#8217;t know any better, either. We&#8217;re just very optimistic about everything. The project, our skills, the tech, your specs, the unknown unknowns &#8230;</p>\n<p>Especially the unknown unknowns are a big problem &#8211; it&#8217;s impossible to predict everything that might go wrong. The variables are just too many.</p>\n<p>Right now it looks like we can do This &#8482; in an hour, but a weirdness or twenty and suddenly it&#8217;s taking a whole day.</p>\n<p>As programmers we assume the least complications, even when multiplying by Pi.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s another profession that gives a lot of predictions in the face of uncertainty &#8211; doctors. When a doctor gets their estimates wrong, people are often delighted. What?</p>\n<p>Let me tell you a tale of two estimates &#8211; a conservative and a programmer estimate.</p>\n<h2>A tale of two estimates</h2>\n<p>Last Friday I messed up my shoulder, more specifically that tiny little joint between my clavicle and shoulder. I was longboarding, did something wrong and landed on tarmac. Hard.</p>\n<p>In the morning I had to use my left hand to eat breakfast. Couldn&#8217;t even pick up a spoon.</p>\n<p>At the ER the doctors told me that hey, the bones and joint seem fine (no dislocation etc.), but I must have messed up my tendons something bad. What I can expect is three weeks of pain and problems. <em>&#8220;Just take some painkillers if it gets too bad&#8221;</em>, they said.</p>\n<p>Today, 6 days later, my shoulder is already at 90%. Clenching my teeth just a little, I could do 60 of my usual 150 pushups this morning. Even <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Skipping rope\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipping_rope\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">jumping rope</a> wasn&#8217;t much of an issue. Yesterday I could even carry a four kilogram longboard in my right arm for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p>In a day or two I will be fully healed, but essentially <strong>the doctor&#8217;s estimate was off by almost a factor of 3<em>.</em></strong> And I couldn&#8217;t be happier, it&#8217;s brightened my whole day up!</p>\n<h3>A programmer&#8217;s estimate</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m working on <a title=\"Web page segmentation\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/web-page-segmentation/swizec/4364\">a web page segmentation algorithm</a>. The idea is to take a website and decide which parts are headers, sidebars and so on. It&#8217;s an interesting problem since everyone else is only concerned with extracting the main juicy content.</p>\n<p>The algorithm finally started working earlier this week, just a matter of merging the results back into the original <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">HTML</a> so they can be useful.</p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;ll have it by Friday morning</em>, I said.</p>\n<p>I mean how hard can it be? I&#8217;m just using a language I hate (java), am not experienced with, a <a title=\"My brain can’t handle OOP anymore\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/my-brain-cant-handle-oop-anymore/swizec/4320\">paradigm I dislike</a> and try to avoid, and a library I only started poking at two weeks ago.</p>\n<p>Surely I can do a task I don&#8217;t fully understand by Friday morning! It&#8217;s the estimate that popped into my mind when I tried to pull something out of my arse, so it must be correct. I&#8217;ve been a programmer for ages!</p>\n<p>Nope, didn&#8217;t get it done.</p>\n<p>Turns out I didn&#8217;t understand the object hierarchy of <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/\" target=\"_blank\">boilerpipe</a> &#8211; took me many hours just to extend the relevant functions of a particular object.</p>\n<p>Then I found out the HTML parser I&#8217;m using is linear, so there is no clear way of deciding which child nodes belong to what <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tree (data structure)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">parent node</a>.</p>\n<p>In the end I spent all of my time just figuring out how to add the algorithm&#8217;s results to the HTML in the crudest way possible &#8211; add a number in front of every node in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Document Object Model\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">the DOM</a>.</p>\n<p>Well oops.</p>\n<h2>Programmers are optimists</h2>\n<p>Whenever you talk to a programmer, just remember, they are an optimistic bunch. Yes, even the most disheartened scruffy old programmer is insanely optimistic. We are the kind of person who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dives into a project with a spec <em>that will change</em></li>\n<li>Grabs a bunch of unknown tools, applies them to an unknown domain &#8230; and wins</li>\n<li>Lies in a different world with every new project</li>\n<li>Changes all their tools every couple of years</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyone who isn&#8217;t an optimist just can&#8217;t survive as a programmer.</p>\n<p>How many other professions can say that about themselves?</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2012/05/top-7-programmers-bad-habits.html\" target=\"_blank\">Top 7 Programmers bad habits</a> (javacodegeeks.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/05/22/the-unknown-unknowns/\" target=\"_blank\">The Unknown Unknowns</a> (skepticblog.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://grokcode.com/722/be-a-paranoid-pessimistic-programmer/\" target=\"_blank\">Be a Paranoid Pessimistic Programmer</a> (grokcode.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://caroldekkers.wordpress.com/2012/04/10/unknown-unknowns/\" target=\"_blank\">Unknown Unknowns&#8230;</a> (caroldekkers.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.samuellevy.com/index.php?p=post&amp;id=15\" target=\"_blank\">On software communities, &#8220;Rock star&#8221; programmers, and&#8230; Linus</a> (samuellevy.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=5b66d765-5cc0-41b5-806e-f5439b842b30\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"53375ad6-2bd8-581a-b9ef-c90a56aaca9f"}}
