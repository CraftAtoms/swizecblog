So much so that I missed my flight home.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Yep, missed it. ‚úàÔ∏è <a href=\"https://t.co/aoDBMsKLEv\">https://t.co/aoDBMsKLEv</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/991666860276903937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 2, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>You&#8217;d think living in San Francisco would make it easy to find a crowd of entrepreneurs to talk to, but no. You have to fly to Vegas and visit MicroConf.</p>\n<p>In San Francisco, there&#8217;s a lot of posturing. Everyone&#8217;s always crushing it. Everyone&#8217;s killing it. That&#8217;s how you get VC money. Nobody&#8217;s gonna invest if you say, <em>&#8220;Look dude, we&#8217;re making sales, but we don&#8217;t really know why.‚Äù</em></p>\n<p>At MicroConf, it&#8217;s different. People are bootstrapped. They grow their business on profits. They start from savings or with a sidehustle. They know how it is.</p>\n<p>Million dollar businesses chatting to thousand dollar businesses as equals; sharing numbers. Quite refreshing.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been a week. Here&#8217;s the good shit that stayed üëáüèª</p>\n<h2>You can make a million dollars with info products</h2>\n<p>This was a lesson from the hallway track. I met a guy who made $1,000,000 in revenue last year from a single info product selling at a single price for one-off purchases.</p>\n<p>Amazing. Inspiring. Took him 5 years of being full time. He didn&#8217;t say how long he worked on it before going full time.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, he has 3 full-time employees, a smattering of freelancers, and worries that he might have to look into a multi-tier pricing structure to sustain growth.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d mention his name, but MicroConf is covered by a FrieNDA, and I don&#8217;t know if he wants numbers published like this.</p>\n<h2>You can have sustainable growth with unsustainable tactics</h2>\n<p>This one is from a talk by <a href=\"https://teachable.com/\">Teachable</a> founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ankurnagpal?lang=en\">Ankur Nagpal</a>. They used a curious growth engine to go from $0 to $10,000,000 ARR (annual recurring revenue) in four years.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This is gonna be fun. $0 to $10 million ARR story <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicroConf?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#MicroConf</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/aylES8614L\">pic.twitter.com/aylES8614L</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/991417124689035265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 1, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how you do it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You set a growth target, say 30% month over month</li>\n<li>You look at where you&#8217;re at, say $2000</li>\n<li>Ok you have to find $600 of revenue this month</li>\n<li>Brainstorm some tactics</li>\n<li>Do them until you have $2600 that month</li>\n<li>The tactic that worked is now your normal process</li>\n<li>Repeat next month</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Teachable started with cold email sales as a tactic, used regular webinars for a while, and landed on the idea of online summits. Each tactic worked for a long while, became better as they standardized it, and eventually stopped producing returns.</p>\n<p>This approach stopped working when they reached $500,000 MRR (monthly recurring revenue). They then had to use more traditional approaches like ads and stuff.</p>\n<p>What I like about this is that it sort of validates what I&#8217;m already doing: Setting a target then figuring out how to get there. But it&#8217;s a system. You can grow and optimize a system.</p>\n<h2>Ads + free content + nurturing == win</h2>\n<p>A short talk from the founder of <a href=\"https://jordangal.lpages.co/jordangal-com/\">Jordan Gal</a> who was able to leverage $4000 in ads into $140,000 in ARR with this one weird trick.</p>\n<p>You write a bunch of free stuff like blog posts.</p>\n<p>You tie them together into a story. They used 6 over 6 weeks for the initial experiment.</p>\n<p>You promote the shit out of them on social media with paid ads and otherwise.</p>\n<p>You tag everyone with a retargeting pixel.</p>\n<p>You now have an audience who has heard about you, trusts your brand, and is interested in what you have to say.</p>\n<p>So you sell them your thing and they buy it.</p>\n<p>Fun fact: This is how I sell my <a href=\"https://swizec.com/reactd3js/\">React + D3v4</a> book. Although I need to tidy up some of those funnels because they stopped working.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t be a corporation</h2>\n<p>Be funny.</p>\n<p>Use emojis. Use gifs.

You can build those channels, you can optimize them, and you can know how many sales you&#8217;re making next month.</p>\n<p>Because if 5,000 people come to your site every month and you convert at 4%, that&#8217;s 200 sales per month like clockwork.
