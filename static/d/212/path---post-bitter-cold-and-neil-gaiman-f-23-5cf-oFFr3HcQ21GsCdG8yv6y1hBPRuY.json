{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Bitter cold and Neil Gaiman","content":"<p>Today I woke up into a somewhat warm room, but my bed was warmer. So I hit snooze, I can afford five more minutes. Then I hit snooze again. And again. And again. Ok so it&#8217;s now been 30 minutes of snoozing in a warm bed. Fuck it, let&#8217;s turn off the alarm, I can be warm for another 15 minutes right? Yes, of course, but it turned into 45 minutes instead. Oops. A quick shower and clothing later and I&#8217;m already on my way to work.</p>\n<p>Getting to work is a five minute walk for me. It was a cold morning, but a refreshing walk. I rather enjoyed it to be honest. But when I got to work something felt funny on my head, it was somewhat itchy and annoying. I go in to scratch it and &#8230; lo and behold, my hair had frozen solid. What the fuck?</p>\n<p>But anyway, I&#8217;ve been reading <a href=\"http://journal.neilgaiman.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Neil Gaiman&#8217;s Journal</a> lately and I like it so much that I want to become one of those Neil Gaiman readers, so I&#8217;ve decided to write him this question:</p>\n<p> <em>Dear Neil Gaiman,</em></p>\n<p><em>I&#8217;m not a crazy fan and have until recently not even known you existed. That was, until I saw Amanda Palmer&#8217;s webcam stream from a dinner with friends she did a while ago (I AM a crazy fan of hers, I admit). You seemed like a cool guy so I decided to check out your blog. This was the epiphany when I realised she doesn&#8217;t say the Google You song was written by an &#8220;unknown gamer&#8221;, but by &#8220;Neil Gaiman&#8221;. Why those two sound so similar I don&#8217;t know, probably because I&#8217;m not english.</em></p>\n<p><em>Anyhow, I really like your blog and find it a delightful read. But seeming as how you write a lot more than just the blog and I&#8217;m becoming increasingly interested in reading your stuff, I was just wondering if you could make a recommendation on where to start? What would you say is your best work to reel in a new reader who has never had any contact with anything you&#8217;ve done?</em></p>\n<p>So yep, I&#8217;m just gonna go ahead and submit that through his &#8220;ask Neil Gaiman&#8221; thingy and hope for the best. Or can either of you readers suggest something?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9bf79726-b4ae-5b46-970e-6251a63bdaf7"}}
