Depending on who requests the court orders, the actions could include <strong>barring online advertising</strong> networks and <strong>payment facilitators</strong> such as PayPal from <strong>doing business</strong> with the <strong>allegedly infringing</strong> website, barring <strong>search engines from linking</strong> to such sites, and requiring <strong>Internet service providers</strong> to <strong>block access</strong> to such sites. The bill would make <strong>unauthorized streaming</strong> of copyrighted content <strong>a crime</strong>, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison for 10 pieces of music or movies within six months. The bill also <strong>gives immunity</strong> to Internet services that <strong>voluntarily take action</strong> against websites dedicated to infringement, while <strong>making liable</strong> for damages any <strong>copyright holder</strong> who knowingly <strong>misrepresents</strong> that a website is dedicated to infringement</p></blockquote>\n<p>Not too bad, if you have a site dedicated to copyright infringement you pretty much get taken offline and put out of business. However, according to The Internet, it is extremely easy to fall under that definition. All it takes is a single piece of user generated content to be infringing and BAM! the whole website goes down.</p>\n<p>You know all those videos of cute kittens with a copyrighted song in the background that you see on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"YouTube\" href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">YouTube</a>? Yeah, that means youtube.com is put out of business.</p>\n<p>Oops.</p>\n<p>As a European there isn&#8217;t really anything I can do about this. But <em>americans</em> can and should!</p>\n<h2>The lynch mob</h2>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WillJamesMob.gif\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"The crowd at the lynching of Will James in Cai...\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/300px-WillJamesMob4.gif\" alt=\"The crowd at the lynching of Will James in Cai...\" width=\"300\" height=\"190\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p>The internet lynch mob has been mobilized. The angle of attack? Boycott supporters of SOPA. A month ago <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Go Daddy\" href=\"http://www.godaddy.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">GoDaddy</a> suffered a mass exoddus of users and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Namecheap\" href=\"http://www.namecheap.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Namecheap</a> turned it into one of the most brilliant marketing stunts I have ever seen.</p>\n<p>Also GoDaddy has made surprising strides in their UI/UX design over the last month, more changes for the better and awesomer than I have seen in the last &#8230; five? Six? years.</p>\n<p>On January 18th reddit.com is going into a blackout, briefly even Wikipedia considered blacking itself out. There is talk google.com and facebook.com will/should be doing the same. Isn&#8217;t that awesome? All these huge sites are against SOPA and are doing <em>something</em>.</p>\n<p>Fighting against rich 50-somethings who don&#8217;t care about the internet beyond what their grandchildren tell them about cute kitten memes by disabling various parts of it? &#8230; yeah, very effective, you can only imagine!</p>\n<p>So a few sites are blacked out, and on the next family gathering the congressperson will hear that their granddaughter was kind of upset for a day because she couldn&#8217;t feed an electronic sheep or something.</p>\n<p>Even if traditional media manages to throw a big hullabaloo about it &#8230; what do you think a mexican standof between the government and the internet will look like? All these companies bleeding <em>millions of dollars</em> every single day, while the congresspeople play golf and chat about how awesome winter break was and plotting how to backstab all the big players next time &#8217;round.</p>\n<p>By the time they have to be re-elected again the whole thing will have blown over and no damage will have been done. Well except for the big sites, who now have a bunch of influental people angry at them.</p>\n<p><a name=\"something_useful\"></a></p>\n<h2>Do something useful instead</h2>\n<p>Instead of being a tempest in a teacup, how about all you american geeks start <em>actually fighting</em> this thing eh? You should!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lobbying_Data.png\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Direct lobbying statistics in the United State...\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/300px-Lobbying_Data3.png\" alt=\"Direct lobbying statistics in the United State...\" width=\"300\" height=\"184\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a small tip I got from a guy who was old enough to pay attention when geeks of Europe fought against software patents and won</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Washington</li>\n<li>Find names of congresspeople</li>\n<li>Find out their habits</li>\n<li>Crash their lunches, crash their breakfast, crash their golf game, crash every social event they have</li>\n<li>Tell them SOPA sucks (perhaps in more eloquent words)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The RIAA and MPAA are <em>doing this</em>.
