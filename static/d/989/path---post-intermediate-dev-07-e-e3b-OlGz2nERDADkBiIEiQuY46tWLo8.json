We&#8217;re going to use Gatsby, and he&#8217;s never worked with React (but knows JS). First thing I did when the boss told me was to send the other a dev a link to your <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/981932124231024640\">Learn While You Poop</a> thread üòä\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Thanks mate!</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nThis is also funny because <strong>the PM approached me like I&#8217;m senior, but I still feel more on the üçºüë∂ end of the skill spectrum</strong>. It seems like clients just assume I&#8217;ve been at it way longer than I have. I just roll with it üò¨\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>Congratz! üëè</p>\n<p>So I asked Mason how long he&#8217;s been doing this: Coding for 6 years, professional web dev for 2-3 years.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not too bad!</p>\n<p>I think that puts Mason solidly in the vast quagmire of <em>Intermediate Developer</em>. A designation that is most hardest to wrestle into an exact definition.</p>\n<p>Large companies, of course, have well-defined ladders you can climb, but that&#8217;s weird.</p>\n<p>To me, an intermediate developer is someone who‚Ä¶</p>\n<ul>\n<li>feels comfortable writing code, </li>\n<li>can come up with solutions on their own, </li>\n<li>often overthinks things,</li>\n<li>shoots themselves in the foot sometimes, and</li>\n<li>just needs exposure to real world problems and time to practice</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That last one is important.</p>\n<p>An intermediate developer is someone who can work independently but needs more experience. Experience is key. The more time you spend solving real-world problems for real-world businesses where the real money is on the line, the better you get.</p>\n<p>No, solving example problems and pre-defined puzzles do not grow you from intermediate to senior. I&#8217;m not even sure it gets you from beginner to intermediate.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s fun though! Do puzzles if you like them. Just know that, in the real world, nobody cares about the elegance of your solution unless there is a specific business requirement that says <em>Must be elegant</em>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8467\" style=\"width: 1546px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8467\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/realworldengineering.jpg\" alt=\"True real world engineering, by Luka Kladaric\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/realworldengineering.jpg 1536w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/realworldengineering-225x300.jpg 225w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/realworldengineering-768x1024.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1536px) 100vw, 1536px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">True real world engineering, by Luka Kladaric</p></div>\n<p>Deployed beats perfect every time. That was the hardest lesson for me to learn.</p>\n<p>Sure, go and be elegant if you&#8217;re building a framework that tens of thousands of engineers are gonna use to solve real-world problems. But that&#8217;s a very special place with very special rules.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So here&#8217;s Mason. He&#8217;s a good guy who isn&#8217;t afraid of anything. But he thinks he&#8217;s not senior enough to guide and mentor someone just starting out.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what Mason forgets üëâ According to the Stack Overflow survey, 67% of software engineers have less than 5 years of professional experience. Five years!</p>\n<p>But think about it. The web reached consumers in 1993 or so. Tim Bernes Lee put <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html\">the very first web page</a> online in August 1991.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s just 27 years ago. The whole industry has existed for only 27 years.</p>\n<p>Did you know that 50% of the world still doesn&#8217;t have internet access? 3.5 billion people left to reach over the next few decades.</p>\n<p>Can you even call putting the first website online the birth of an industry? ü§î Was the automobile industry born in 1885 when Benz created his Motorwagen, the first internal combustion vehicle?</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8467\" style=\"width: 1546px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8467\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Benz-1.jpg\" alt=\"True real world engineering, by Luka Kladaric\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The first car, 1885</p></div>\n<p>Let&#8217;s see, 1885 plus 27 years &#8230; 1912. Just 4 years after the first mass-produced car, the Model T.</p>\n<p>That sounds about right, doesn&#8217;t it? The web is just entering the era of mass production of web pages and websites and all sorts of web things.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8467\" style=\"width: 1546px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8467\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/2560px-1925_Ford_Model_T_touring-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"True real world engineering, by Luka Kladaric\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">1885 + 27 ‚Üí mass production of cars</p></div>\n<p>This mass production is what&#8217;s driving the democratization of web development as a profession that we&#8217;re seeing right now. More and more people are getting into web dev using better and better tools.</p>\n<p>Just like factory workers in the early 20th century. The industry was booming, and everyone wanted to build cars. That&#8217;s where the jobs were.</p>\n<p>Programs were started to teach people just enough skills to be productive in a factory. People were trained up fast and worked hard.</p>\n<p>Give them the right tools and processes and anyone can build a car! Everyone should go build cars! We have more orders to fill than people to fulfill them!</p>\n<p>You know, just like everyone should go to a boot camp or a school and become a Web Developer. Learn a specific tool, a specific process, crank things out as fast as you can.</p>\n<p>But not everyone can design a car. You need an engineer for that.</p>\n<p>Be the person who builds the tools and designs the solutions. ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c703bdef-e3e8-5222-b953-b76d76e8e3ff"}}
