Just brilliant.</p>\n<p>My video about getting a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed2xrQt0Qp4\">new 2017 Macbook Pro</a> got 1000 views. My first ever video to do so in a reasonable amount of time. I have some old ones that got that much over like 6 years but that doesn&#8217;t count.</p>\n<p>Honestly it&#8217;s the best video I ever made. Took some advice from Casey&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q980C74SdYQ\">how to vlog like Casey</a> video. More cinematic shots, less first person shaky cam, more attention to having a real story arc.</p>\n<p>It worked. Now I just gotta figure out how I can make all my videos like that. And how can I make more videos in the first place. I&#8217;d love for each and every of my articles/blogposts to have a video attached to it, but there just aren&#8217;t enough hours in the day.</p>\n<p>Or I&#8217;m too slow at making the things ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Oh and <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/first-day-new-2017-macbook-pro/swizec/7643\">I got a new laptop</a>! Paid for in full by the sidehustle. Achievement unlocked! Although it did create some cashflow problems ðŸ¤”</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re buying a new $3000 laptop, don&#8217;t at the same time forget about an unpaid $2500 invoice for your tax accountant who <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/how-i-got-boned-by-taxes-two-years-in-a-row/swizec/7582\">probably saved you plenty of money on taxes</a>. Probably &#8230; Not like I can afford a second opinion at these rates ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>What else?</p>\n<p>Oh! I ran a <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/initial-results-patreon-experiment/swizec/7666\">Patreon experiment</a> and I can&#8217;t decide if it was a smashing success or an abject failure. But the sidehustle does have $46 in monthly recurring revenue now.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll figure out how to grow that I&#8217;m sure. It&#8217;s like traffic and email subscribers. Getting a bunch of people to your blog is great, but if you can turn them into subscribers who keep coming back, then you&#8217;re actually building something.</p>\n<p>Same with selling. Subscribers trump one offs. You can build a real scalable business on stuff that people come back to buy. Very hard to build a scalable business on stuff people buy once and never need again.</p>\n<p>So here&#8217;s June in numbers ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<p><strong>Total revenue:</strong> $4,093</p>\n<p><strong>Gumroad sales:</strong> $1064<br />\n&#8211; React+D3v4: $735 &#8211; fees<br />\n&#8211; React+D3 ES6: $383 &#8211; fees<br />\n&#8211; ES6 Cheatsheet: $22 &#8211; fees</p>\n<p><strong>Leanpub sales:</strong> $418<br />\n&#8211; Why Programmers Work at Night: $24<br />\n&#8211; React+D3: $20<br />\n&#8211; React+D3 ES6: $374</p>\n<p>Why do people still buy the very first edition of React+D3? I should retire it ðŸ¤”</p>\n<p><strong>React Native School:</strong> $1467</p>\n<p><strong>Packt Quarterly Royalties:</strong> $865</p>\n<p><strong>Time investment:</strong> 60 hours</p>\n<p><strong>Expenses:</strong> $5041</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook Pro: $3269</li>\n<li>Dongles: $178</li>\n<li>Editor: $500</li>\n<li>VA: $325</li>\n<li>Facebook Ads: $236</li>\n<li>99designs: $200</li>\n<li>Hosting: $10</li>\n<li>LiveEdu: $10</li>\n<li>Drip: $184</li>\n<li>Mailchimp: $20</li>\n<li>Flaticon: $10</li>\n<li>SumoMe: $99</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I should really merge Drip and Mailchimp and stop using the chimp. It&#8217;s not like I ever send email to those people anymore, it&#8217;s just a waste of money. I think the only reason I keep it is because of Why Programmers Work at Night and Leanpub&#8217;s integration with Mailchimp. And lack of integration with Drip.</p>\n<p><strong>Hourly rate after expenses:</strong> -$15.8</p>\n<p>ðŸ˜…</p>\n<p>This is what you would call a loss month. Oops.</p>\n<p>But hey, the laptop is going to more than amortize over the next 5 years of its useful lifespan. Even if it&#8217;s just 4 years, it&#8217;s gonna be put to work. Hard.</p>\n<p><strong>PS:</strong> React+D3v4 is almost donesky. Got through test driving most of it, decided to add a chapter on React Native, and my intrepid editor is almost done fixing my grammar fuckups. It&#8217;s turning out great. Best React book ever.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f4cc7b66-5e9e-5398-9088-4473e8beed3d"}}
