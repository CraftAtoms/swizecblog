I could do with that.</p>\n<p>Okay overpriced journal recommended by internet celebrities, I&#8217;ll give you a shot. What&#8217;s the worst that can happen?</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Five Minute Journal. Let’s do this</p>\n<p>Also brilliant way to ensure Product stickiness. Whomever made this thing is a genius in product design. <a href=\"https://t.co/waAidT11vf\">pic.twitter.com/waAidT11vf</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/983166955858227200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 9, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The journal starts with a 50 page introduction that explains how it works. You&#8217;re going to spend 5 minutes every day. 3 in the morning, 2 in the evening.</p>\n<p>Both are guided gratitude sessions.</p>\n<p>You start with listing 3 things you&#8217;re grateful for, followed by 3 things that would make today amazing, and 1 line of self affirmation. The 50 page introduction explains the science behind gratitude, lists studies that showed it helps people live better lives, and mentions that while self-affirmations sound stupid, they do in fact work and are backed by science.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not a stretch to think that telling yourself you&#8217;re a horrible person who can&#8217;t do nothing right every day, is going to have a different effect than telling yourself how great you are.</p>\n<p>The guide explains that you aren&#8217;t meant to stroke your own ego. You&#8217;re supposed to focus on one or two positive traits you don&#8217;t have, and emphasize those. Imagine yourself being the person you want to become.</p>\n<p>For example, I often get distracted by the internet while working. So I started writing in my Five Minute Journal every morning that <em>&#8220;I am a focused person&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p>I have become more focused. It&#8217;s weird.</p>\n<p>But now I miss shooting the piss on Twitter. So sad.</p>\n<p>In the evening, you&#8217;re going to do something similar. You get a prompt that asks for 3 amazing things that happened today, and 2 things you could have done better.</p>\n<p>Everything revolves around what <em>you</em> are going to do and what <em>you</em> could have done and what <em>you</em> are grateful for. Writing down <em>&#8220;Winning the lottery today would be amazing&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;It would be great if my boss gave me a raise out of the blue&#8221;</em> will not fly.</p>\n<p>Yes those would be amazing things that could happen today. But they are not things that are in your control. This is about empowerment.</p>\n<p>The introduction is followed by one of the best tricks of product design I have ever seen: A page you fill out like a contract.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;I Swizec Teller am going to write this journal every day for 5 days. I will ensure this happens by doing the morning part before , and the evening part right after . I will ask persons to keep me accountable. If I do it, I will reward myself with <a>, and if I falter I will punish myself with <b>&#8220;</b></a></em></p>\n<p>Brilliant.</p>\n<h2>Holy shit gratitude is hard</h2>\n<p>So I did the thing for a week. Every morning. Every evening.</p>\n<p>It was easy at first. What are you grateful for? Oh my girlfriend and my bird and I have a nice apartment and I&#8217;m in the city I always wanted to be in and all the things.</p>\n<p>But then comes day 6. You&#8217;re a little hung over. A little tired. A little over the novelty. A little annoyed at your snoring girlfriend drooling all over your pillow.</p>\n<p>What are you grateful for?</p>\n<p>Err &#8230; uhm &#8230; I&#8217;m alive? No that seems stupid. I like my girl? Nah she ate my cookie last night. The bird? Ugh, he&#8217;s screaming to be let out of his cage, I can&#8217;t even hear myself think about what I&#8217;m fucking grateful for.</p>\n<p>But you force it out of yourself. I am grateful for my stupid loud bird and my girlfriend is okay even though her feet are cold in the night.</p>\n<p>And your mood improves. You chuckle. You write down 3 amazing ideas for the day and you tell yourself you&#8217;re beautiful.</p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;re ready for anything.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"679cbf60-de8a-5e74-ae13-0e95a139fc1b"}}
