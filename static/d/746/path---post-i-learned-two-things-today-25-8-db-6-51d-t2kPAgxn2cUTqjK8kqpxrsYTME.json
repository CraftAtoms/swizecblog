We have a coffee culture. </p>\n<p>In the evenings when it gets a bit cooler and you can actually breathe, people start crawling out of the woodwork and into the coffee shops all over town centre.</p>\n<p>Having a cup of iced tea in the middle of this buzz, writing blogs and watching people just chill without being in a hurry &#8230; it&#8217;s pretty cool for doing creative stuff. Much better than Palo Alto where everyone seems constantly in a hurry because they&#8217;re all startup people. Perhaps San Francisco has more of a chillaxed evening culture, but I got the impression in the US there&#8217;s more of a Saturday/Sunday brunch culture.</p>\n<p>Another thing I learned is that jet lag can be an incredibly useful study aide. Turns out it&#8217;s much easier to pull an all nighter studying for an exam when it feels like mid afternoon.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s just hope I don&#8217;t learn tomorrow that studying all night for an exam is counterproductive to passing said exam ðŸ™‚</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"71e4e548-1c2d-5472-a799-e0134cf6760e"}}
