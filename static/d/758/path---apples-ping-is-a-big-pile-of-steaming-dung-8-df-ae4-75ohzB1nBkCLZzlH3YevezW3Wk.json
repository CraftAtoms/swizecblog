Gee, how bloody creative of them and they used to be so cool. There are enough social networks, too many actually. But I digress.</p>\n<p>Yesterday when I updated iTunes and got the slightly odd new version (what&#8217;s with the vertical window buttons anyway?) there was no Ping in sight.

There it was! Let&#8217;s go click that bad boy.</p>\n<p>The first screen was pretty nice, some blahblahblah about how this is a social network and can do socially stuff. Create account!</p>\n<p>Ok, first thing that&#8217;s a bit odd is that my Ping account is the same as my <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/itunes_store\" title=\"ITunes Store\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://itunes.com\">iTunes store</a> account.

Not really a fan, some songs are good, but meh.

The artists I do find are labeled as users and everybody knows it&#8217;s not really them there, it&#8217;s some automated bot thing to keep us notified of their stuff.
