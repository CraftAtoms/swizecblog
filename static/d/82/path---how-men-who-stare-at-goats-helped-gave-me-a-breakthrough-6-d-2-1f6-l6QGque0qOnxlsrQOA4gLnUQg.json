{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"How Men Who Stare At Goats gave me a breakthrough","content":"<p>Last night I was faced with a daunting task of making a <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/metaheuristic\" title=\"Metaheuristic\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic\">meta-heuristic</a> process a non-trivial amount of data in no more than a tenth of the time it was taking now.</p>\n<p>Just to help you embrace the herculean task this was: My goal was to make the algorithm&#8217;s runtime lower than 1.5 seconds for any realistic data sample. It was taking anywhere from 5 to 20 and even 30 seconds at the time.</p>\n<p>So I set off. First some profiling and some tidbits here and there, then tweaking and poking and yanking and scraping code for <em>hours upon hours upon hours.</em></p>\n<p>Nothing, no increase in performance. Nothing even remote to sane behaviour at all. Even though the algorithm was working, my debugging/profiling data wasn&#8217;t making any sense.</p>\n<p>And I said fuck this shit and went to chillax and rest my mind over <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Men Who Stare at Goats\" rel=\"amazon\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Men-Who-Stare-at-Goats/dp/0330375482%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D0330375482\">Men Who Stare at Goats</a> for two hours.</p>\n<p><object width=\"560\" height=\"340\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GC2TzspJn5A&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/GC2TzspJn5A&#038;hl=en_US&#038;fs=1&#038;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" width=\"560\" height=\"340\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>There were some good laughs and some pretty good chillaxing being done. My I-don&#8217;t-know-which-exactly-or-what&#8217;s-it-called part of the brain was probably busy processing the afore mentioned problem in the background. Or maybe it wasn&#8217;t, who knows.</p>\n<p>All I know is that when I came back to the problem I noticed something funky.</p>\n<p>HEY THAT FUNCTION ARGUMENT SHOULDN&#8217;T BE A FUCKING CONSTANT WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON!</p>\n<p>Characters 1 and t look a lot alike &#8230;</p>\n<p>So anyway, long story short. The meta-heuristic that used to take 1500 epochs to do something now takes only <em><strong>ten</strong></em> to do the same thing, but slightly better.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a pretty fucking good improovement right there!</p>\n<p>Now the algorithm is constantly taking about a second to do its thing and I&#8217;m happy. Pushed it into production where profiling data will be collected of a more varied sample of data to see if all is well.</p>\n<p>Chillaxing! It really does work.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/9b21d896-9c08-4f43-8180-2ccdffa12a70/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=9b21d896-9c08-4f43-8180-2ccdffa12a70\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b4b5290f-cffe-5c45-802c-2fc49e91dd6f"}}
