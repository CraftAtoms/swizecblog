{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Web page segmentation","content":"<p>The Internet talks a lot about article extraction &#8211; taking a page and deciding what the real content is. Hell, I&#8217;ve written about the <a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/fruitblog/the-uncanny-valley-of-web-scraping/\" target=\"_blank\">Uncanny valley of web scraping</a> myself.</p>\n<p>Article extraction is such a wide spread problem that a bunch of API&#8217;s exist to help you solve it. Everything from a fringe feature in five or ten semantic API&#8217;s, to startups devoted wholly to extracting articles &#8211; like Diffbot.</p>\n<p>But what if you don&#8217;t want to extract an article? What if all you want is: <em>this is the header, here is a sidebar, these are ads, here is content, oh and this is a footer, btw those are comments.</em></p>\n<img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Visual vs. Densitometric segmentation (expected)\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/KwdOq.png\" alt=\"Visual vs. Densitometric segmentation (expected)\" width=\"567\" height=\"273\" />\n<p>Suddenly you are shit out of luck.</p>\n<p>Sure, it makes sense the API&#8217;s wouldn&#8217;t let you do this &#8211; it&#8217;s supposedly their secret magic sauce. Right?</p>\n<p>Except it isn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Analyzing the different implementations of article extractors reveals that far from using a methodical approach of marking up different bits of a page, they mostly work as tree <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Pruning (decision trees)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pruning_%28decision_trees%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">pruning algorithms</a> &#8211; go through <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Document Object Model\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">DOM</a>, remove anything that&#8217;s not promising, end up with the juicy article.</p>\n<p>Nothing you could use to create a web page segmentor &#8230;</p>\n<p>Turns out, there is but a single very useful paper devoted to web page segmentation &#8211; Christian Kohlschütter&#8217;s <em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcoitweb.uncc.edu%2F~jfan%2Fwebimage2.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">A Densitometric Approach to Web Page Segmentation</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Yep, the same guy who later wrote <em>Boilerplate Detection using Shallow Text Features, </em>which later turned into <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/boilerpipe/\" target=\"_blank\">Boilerpipe</a>, one of the best (most certainly the quickest) libraries web content extraction.</p>\n<p>In the paper Kohlschütter explains that only three approaches exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>segmenting visually</li>\n<li>linguistic approach</li>\n<li>densitometric approach</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Visual segmentation is perhaps the easiest to understand &#8211; you <em>look</em> at a website and as a person you instantly know where different sections are. A computer vision algorithm could do something similar. With the caveat you now have to render every page, then run a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Visual learning\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_learning\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">visual learning</a> algorithm and do a bunch of things that are computationally very expensive.</p>\n<p>The linguistic approach is somewhat more reasonable &#8211; take a page, look at distributions of words and syllables and what have you (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_linguistics\" target=\"_blank\">quanititive linguistics</a> this is called) and decide based on that. Problem here is, this only works well for large blocks of text &#8230; the linguistic content in, say, a header might be somewhat lacking.</p>\n<h2>Block fusion algorithm</h2>\n<img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"Visual vs. Densitometric (actual)\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/LCupU.png\" alt=\"Visual vs. Densitometric (actual)\" width=\"636\" height=\"287\" />\n<p>Kohlschütter&#8217;s densitometric approach has a tendency to work as well as a visual algorithm, while being as fast as a lingustic approach &#8230; bloody marvelous!</p>\n<p>The idea is basically this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>walk through nodes</li>\n<li>assign a text density to each node -&gt; number-of-tokens / number-of-&#8216;lines&#8217;</li>\n<li>merge neighbor nodes with the same densities</li>\n<li>repeat until desired granularity is reached</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The simplicity of this algorithm is just brilliant. Even better is the fact they managed to get it down to <em>15ms</em> per page on average. For comparison&#8217;s sake &#8211; the time it takes Readability to clean up a page is counted in seconds, an average response time from Diffbot (visual approach) is about <em>10 seconds per page.</em></p>\n<p>Yep, that fast.</p>\n<p>And for the icing on the cake &#8211; most main bits of the Block Fusion Algorithm are already implemented deep inside the bowels of Boilerpipe. You just have to look hard enough.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/fruitblog/the-uncanny-valley-of-web-scraping/\" target=\"_blank\">The uncanny valley of web scraping</a> (zemanta.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.marketingtechblog.com/eyequant/\" target=\"_blank\">Eyequant: Heatmapping on the Fly</a> (marketingtechblog.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2012/05/14/152444019/algorithms-the-ever-growing-all-knowing-way-of-the-future?ft=1&amp;f=1049\" target=\"_blank\">Algorithms: The Ever-Growing, All-Knowing Way Of The Future</a> (npr.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.daniweb.com/software-development/python/threads/423356/webscraping-with-beautiful-soup-extracting-images\" target=\"_blank\">webscraping with beautiful soup (extracting images)</a> (daniweb.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/05/15/machine-learning-in-action/\" target=\"_blank\">Machine Learning in Action</a> (johndcook.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=80957035-03c6-4cce-93f6-3c07a987921a\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"116a6764-557f-5e23-a00b-cc7acf24e050"}}
