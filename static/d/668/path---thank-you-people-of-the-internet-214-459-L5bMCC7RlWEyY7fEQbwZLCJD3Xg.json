{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Thank you people of the internet","content":"<p>Two days ago somebody stole the most popular article I&#8217;ve ever written &#8211; <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198\">Why Programmers Work At Night</a>. The single most shared and reposted and stolen thing I&#8217;ve ever made.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the best thing I&#8217;ve ever written. God no. When I look at it now I think it flows poorly, uses strange wording, sounds weak and is just a mess. My writing has improved in three years.</p>\n<p>Wow, three years.</p>\n<p>But I remember when I first posted it. I just wanted to fill my post-every-day quota, my then girlfriend giving me the death stare because I kept writing well into our date because I had slept in that morning.</p>\n<p>She helped me pick the pictures. I hit publish and started apologizing for being so rude.</p>\n<p>Then everything went insane with the shares and the upvotes and the comments and the retweets. 200,000 uniques in two days.</p>\n<p>Some websites steal the article. Some ask for permission to repost. I&#8217;ve seen translations into various languages, some I couldn&#8217;t even read the letters of.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s weird. But I don&#8217;t mind. Spam websites gonna spam, right?</p>\n<p>But two days ago somebody stole it verbatim again. No attribution. Then they committed the greatest sin of the internets &#8211; posted their link to r/programming and to <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Hacker News\" href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Hacker News</a>.</p>\n<p>My fans &#8230;fans is a strong word, I should say friends &#8230; my friends got Hacker News to fix the submission link. A single comment was enough.</p>\n<p>On <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Reddit\" href=\"http://reddit.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Reddit</a> there was no correction, but several comments mentioned that this was a spam submission and linked to the original article.</p>\n<p>I had no idea any of this was going on.</p>\n<p>But I woke up that morning to tweets from a few different people saying <em>&#8220;Hey dude, that guy stole your article and we are *</em>not** okay with that!&#8221;*.</p>\n<p>Someone even let me know via Skype.</p>\n<p>But the best thing about this incident is that because I have amazing friends and good SEO, I sold 9 copies of the book that stemmed out of that article. It usually takes a month to sell that many. And 50 new mailing list subscribers to boot. Normally I get 5 a month.</p>\n<p>All that without attribution from the thieving website! Amazing.</p>\n<p>Thanks friends, fans, people of the internet, whatever I should call you. You&#8217;re great. It warms my weasely black heart to see people care about my writing enough to make a fuss when it&#8217;s misappropriated.</p>\n<p>I should probably finish that book huh &#8230;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2bb3240f-1d37-5d6f-b6a9-b006c6421c8f"}}
