At the time I didn&#8217;t really give it much thought because everything else from <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"iPad\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipad/\" rel=\"homepage\">the iPad</a> to the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"iPhone\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/iphone\" rel=\"homepage\">iPhone</a> to all the other laptops at home connected just fine and since I have a desktop computer as well there wasn&#8217;t really much need to fuss.</p>\n<p>A couple of weeks later I realized that turning off security on my network allows the Mac Laptop to connect just fine &#8230; ok, I thought, so it must be due to something with the security settings. I&#8217;m guessing <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Works Progress Administration\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration\" rel=\"wikipedia\">WPA</a> just doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore and Apple is doing their thing and pushing everyone forward. Just like they were the first to stop with floppy and CD drives on some computers.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll just buy a new router that supports WPA2 then, more security never really hurt anyone.</p>\n<p>Again, I had enough other devices that connected just fine and didn&#8217;t feel like fussing about it. Plus by this time I had discovered a neighbour&#8217;s wi-fi for the most important of internet things.</p>\n<p>Eventually I got so used to the neighbour&#8217;s wifi I started using <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Spotify\" href=\"http://www.spotify.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Spotify</a>Â and some other things that need quite a bit of oomph.</p>\n<p>Then two days ago the builders working on the facade of my building put up scaffolding outside my room and suddenly that friendly neighbour&#8217;s wifi didn&#8217;t work anymore!</p>\n<p>At least not that well!</p>\n<p>Therefore I was forced to fix the issue immediately and discovered that there is a very freaking weird bug in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mac OS X Lion\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion\" rel=\"homepage\">Mac OS X Lion</a>.</p>\n<p>Apparently when you upgrade from <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Snow Leopard\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Leopard\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Snow Leopard</a> to Lion sometimes (all the time?) your keychain will get screwed up. This means you suddenly lose connectivity to all networks that require login and you have previously used!</p>\n<p>The fix is &#8220;simple&#8221;:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Remove all networks from networks list</li>\n<li>Open Keychain and remove all Airport passwords from System</li>\n<li>Reboot</li>\n<li>Voila, connectivity!</li>\n</ol>\n<div>If this is the sign of things to come as <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Steve Jobs\" href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/person/steve-jobs\" rel=\"crunchbase\">Steve Jobs</a> moves away from Apple I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to like using these products much longer &#8230;</div>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=ab1bde25-40d9-4f5b-b991-76e6f6f18771\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"fa9fb457-2c49-5e6d-a293-bc52338b821b"}}
