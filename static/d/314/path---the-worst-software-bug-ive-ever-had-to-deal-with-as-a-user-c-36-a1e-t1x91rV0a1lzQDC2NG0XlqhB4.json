The lot of you. I know you did.</p>\n<p>For those who didn&#8217;t, here&#8217;s the back story:</p>\n<p>A few years ago <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apple\" href=\"http://www.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Apple</a> released OSX Mavericks. This went well. But if you updated MS Office too, it didn&#8217;t go well. If there was any trace of Office 2008 left, you got the infamous <em>&#8220;updating font menu EXC_BAD_ACCESS&#8221;</em> crash.</p>\n<p>Immediately on startup.</p>\n<p>Open any Office app. Word, Excel, Outlook, doesn&#8217;t matter. Within three seconds of starting, it crashed. Before you even got past the loading screen.</p>\n<p>The solution was moderately simple &#8211; delete all traces of Office from <code>~/Library</code> and <code>/Library</code>. All the config files, all the everything. You could supposedly get away with just deleting the default template files.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Fuck it, I&#8217;ll just use <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"LibreOffice\" href=\"http://www.libreoffice.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">LibreOffice</a>&#8220;</em></p>\n<p>And for two years life was good. Well, life was passable. LibreOffice is great and all, and Apple&#8217;s Pages is awesome, but when you&#8217;re dealing with publishers and editors and you have tens of people touching the same .doc or .docx file &#8230;</p>\n<p>Well, LibreOffice becomes a steaming pile of turd. And slow. Track and show changes always made me feel like I was back in the late 1990&#8217;s working on a computer with a 166MHz processor and 16MB of memory.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday life was no longer good. A file came back from the editors and neither LibreOffice nor Pages would open it. You could click on the images, you knew they were there, but they were invisible.</p>\n<p>Fuck.</p>\n<p>So I pirated me some MS Office for Mac.</p>\n<p>And it crashed. Updating font menu. EXC_BAD_ACCES. Boom.</p>\n<p>Deleting all config files from everywhere didn&#8217;t work. Rebooting my machine didn&#8217;t work. Nothing worked.</p>\n<p>Pirated version. Obviously.</p>\n<p>140‚Ç¨ and two hours of deleting absolutely everything yet again later aaaaaaand &#8230; nope.</p>\n<p>Crash. EXC_BAD_ACCESS. Boom.</p>\n<p>By this point, I had spent <em>hours</em> trying to get Word to work. I have seen every single article and official answer on the internet. Just delete your preferences, all will be fine.</p>\n<p>But it wasn&#8217;t fine!</p>\n<p>As a last desperate measure, I created a new user account just to try Word in.</p>\n<p>It worked. Without a hitch. Started up. Was fast. Flawless.</p>\n<p><strong>#$%!#@$!@~#&amp;^</strong>*</p>\n<p>HOW!?</p>\n<p>An hour of Googling later I came across a forum thread for school system administrators. Just a month old. Who knew people still used forums.</p>\n<p>But a solution they did find!</p>\n<p>If you run any of Adobe&#8217;s CS6 software <em>before</em> running any MS Office software, the font cache goes weird and Word will crash.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s right. When you start a new account. You have to run Office apps before running CS6 apps.</p>\n<p>üòê</p>\n<p>O.o</p>\n<p>o.O</p>\n<p>Wat!?</p>\n<p>But I deleted <code>~/Library/Fonts</code> and Word worked! I can edit documents like a human being!</p>\n<p>Seriously, Word impressed me. It&#8217;s smooth, it&#8217;s fast, it&#8217;s got a distraction-free mode. It&#8217;s amazing. Never going back to LibreOffice.</p>\n<p>But now I&#8217;m too afraid to try running <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adobe Photoshop\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Photoshop</a>.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0401586e-b338-5509-a447-10faac1c2584"}}
