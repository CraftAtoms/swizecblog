It&#8217;s very rare to get a chance to drive in conditions where everyone is nice and calm. Nobody honks at you, nobody tries to swerve around you and do stupid things, nobody is in a hurry. It&#8217;s just fucking awesome!</p>\n<p>Not to mention the snow and the occasional drift around a corner! Orgasmic! Oh!</p>\n<p>Although winter services could be a little more vigilant, I got thrown all over the place driving through tracks others made. There was snow up to 20 centimeters deep someplaces! On main roads!!</p>\n<p>Anyway, had fun, was awesome, got stuck in the snow on the parking lot at home. That was a big lol, but a surprisingly large amount of people I don&#8217;t know decided to be helpful and we got the car into a parking space in no time.</p>\n<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00156.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1072\" title=\"IMG00156\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00156.jpg\" alt=\"IMG00156\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00153.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1071\" title=\"IMG00153\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00153.jpg\" alt=\"IMG00153\" width=\"528\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00153.jpg 528w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00153-300x227.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 528px) 100vw, 528px\" /></a><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00152.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1070\" title=\"IMG00152\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG00152.jpg\" alt=\"IMG00152\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/87c0cdc9-629f-4974-91db-5b1a8a7e985f/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=87c0cdc9-629f-4974-91db-5b1a8a7e985f\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"59f156fe-3205-537d-8224-2c8ef393f842"}}
