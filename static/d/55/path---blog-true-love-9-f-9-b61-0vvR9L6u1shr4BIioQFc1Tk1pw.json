{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"True love","content":"<p>\nMy girlfriend isn&#39;t a drop-dead gorgeous person, in fact I&#39;m certain to many she doesn&#39;t even seem attractive. She&#39;s a tad on the chubby side, has strange fingernails, weirdly positioned teeth, strange jaw-bone structure, could do with a tad better cheekbones, her eyes aren&#39;t properly aligned on her face, she doesn&#39;t have long legs and doesn&#39;t seem to know how to make herself look better with make-up and clothing. She&#39;s not even that great personality-wise, she&#39;s whiny, sulky, has a lot of baggage and she&#39;s prone to burst of such deep despair it makes your heart shrivel up and die.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut you know what? None of that really matters and I hope she doesn&#39;t change any of it save for the personality stuff. It&#39;s what makes her her and I enjoy every little imperfection I can find because to me she&#39;s the prettiest and awesomest person there can be.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat, I believe, is true love. I&#39;m still not quite certain how it comes about, but at least I&#39;ve now figured out what it is &#8230; it&#39;s knowing all of your partner&#39;s flaws and simply not finding them at all important. To knowingly be with someone despite all their problems and imperfections, what else could that be than love?\n</p>\n<p>\nDespair perhaps, a fluke of monogamic social organisation &#8230; but let&#39;s call it love for now.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"38f028b2-e00a-5b52-a05f-45ad33af542c"}}
