The first was after I came back from the <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/60-seconds-2000-miles/swizec/7334\">epic Grand Canyon roadtrip</a>. The second is right now, coming back from a company retreat in Cabo.</p>\n<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love vacation. I <em>need</em> vacation. Coming back from vacation and restarting the pre-vacation momentum is the death. Newton&#39;s first law: An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.</p>\n<p>You can think of daily productive habits as momentum. If you go to work for 8 hours every day, doing so becomes reflexive. Momentum. If you go to the gym every day after work, you&#39;ll keep doing it unless you make an active decision not to. Momentum.</p>\n<p>If you write an article or make a video every day, you can keep doing it. Sometimes it’s easier, sometimes it’s harder, but it&#39;s easy to put <em>something</em> out there. Even if you write every other day, you can keep doing it almost without thinking. Momentum.</p>\n<p>And then vacation stops all that.</p>\n<p>The unbalanced force of vacation throws you out of whack. Maybe you can keep up some daily exercise, but it&#39;s not quite the same as going to the gym. Maybe you can keep writing a little bit…</p>\n<p>But the pool and jacuzzi and cocktails and friends and nightclubs and lounge chairs and books are soooooooo inviting, and you realize just how tired you&#39;ve been all these weeks. You deserve a little break, don&#39;t you? God damn it, you&#39;ve earned it!</p>\n<p>So you don&#39;t. And then you&#39;re fucked.</p>\n<p>Do you reeeaaaaally want to get back to all of that work you&#39;ve been doing before? Like <em>really</em> really? You loved it, and you loved the results for sure, but you can&#39;t deny how much easier life would be if you, you know, <em>didn&#39;t</em>. You just saw how easy it was. Relaxing and nice and nothing bad happened.</p>\n<p>Or did it?</p>\n<p>In my case, not writing has a direct effect on traffic. The classic content treadmill problem.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7462\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/traffic-chart.png\" width=\"1154\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/traffic-chart.png 1154w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/traffic-chart-300x56.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/traffic-chart-768x142.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/traffic-chart-1024x190.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1154px) 100vw, 1154px\" />\n<p>At the end of December, I went on a roadtrip, and traffic went down. Then in January, it took a few weeks for the traffic to build back up. Then I fell off the wagon and started posting irregularly again, and traffic fell down to maintenance levels.</p>\n<p>The week off didn&#39;t have as much of an effect as it did in December, but we&#39;ll see what happens. Stitching together a newsletter for Friday is going to be hard. ?</p>\n<p>Fingers crossed this short rumination starts the momentum.
