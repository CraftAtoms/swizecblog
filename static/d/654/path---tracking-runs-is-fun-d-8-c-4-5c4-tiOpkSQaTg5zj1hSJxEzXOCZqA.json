Tomorrow I&#8217;m testing the hypotesis to make sure it wasn&#8217;t a one-time fluke.</p>\n<p>The trick is to start it up when you&#8217;re home. Then after the warmup walk kill it and open it again. This time GPS connect is instant.</p>\n<p>But the true lesson for today is that tracking runs is FUN. I even got a map and everything ðŸ˜€ Sure it looks a bit weird where it decided I was running zigzag through houses and trees and cars and garages and pretty much everything at a sooper speed of <strong>30! </strong>kilometers per hour.</p>\n<p>But hey, it&#8217;s a blackberry not an iPhone (or Android), so I shan&#8217;t complain. I&#8217;m just glad I can finally use this crap.</p>\n<p>Hmmm &#8230; for some reason wordpress won&#8217;t let me embed the map, so here&#8217;s a screenshot.</p>\n<a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-9.51.27-AM.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1323\" title=\"Screen shot 2010-04-30 at 9.51.27 AM\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-9.51.27-AM.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"799\" height=\"529\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-9.51.27-AM.png 799w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/Screen-shot-2010-04-30-at-9.51.27-AM-300x198.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\" /></a>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/7512ac06-9c72-4184-92e8-eafed79ca5bd/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=7512ac06-9c72-4184-92e8-eafed79ca5bd\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"21fc2867-d73d-5f4f-bf3b-280391176a64"}}
