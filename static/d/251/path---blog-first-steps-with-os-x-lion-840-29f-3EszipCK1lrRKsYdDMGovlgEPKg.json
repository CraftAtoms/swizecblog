{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"First steps with OS X Lion","content":"<p>A couple of days ago <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apple\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.apple.com\">Apple</a> released the GM version of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mac OS X Lion\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion\">OS X Lion</a> to developers. Yesterday I finally got around to installing it and trying it out. It often happens that this is the final version of a new OS that ends up on consumer&#8217;s hard drives, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to be the case this time &#8217;round. In some ways the thing is almost as buggy as your average beta <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Ubuntu (operating system)\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> release.</p>\n<img class=\" \" style=\"float: right; width: 350px; margin: 15px;\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/68za7.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>Just a couple of things noticed since yesterday:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@mihar couldn&#8217;t login after update until he did a fresh install</li>\n<li>my sound died last night and was gone until I rebooted</li>\n<li>sometimes parts of the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Graphical user interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\">GUI</a> don&#8217;t refresh and there are left over glitches</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Actually that&#8217;s not too bad, I really felt like I noticed more things than that &#8230; guess I&#8217;ve grown a little bit spoiled. If this was Ubuntu I&#8217;d probably call it beyond ready for release and super awesome bug free and so on. But on a Mac it makes me want to bitch and moan.</p>\n<p>Oh us <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Spoiled child\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoiled_child\">spoiled brats</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, I have to say I really love the new features. Probably haven&#8217;t discovered all of them and I don&#8217;t want to look for spoilers in the keynote. It&#8217;s much more fun just using the OS and being nicely delighted on every step of the way.</p>\n<p><!--more-->The general theme is: Make everything more <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"iPad\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/ipad/\">iPad</a>-y.</p>\n<p>Actually, I&#8217;m going to make the rest of this post in screenshots and captions.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 748px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" \" title=\"This is simply the sexiest login screen ever\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/68za7.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"738\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">This is simply the sexiest login screen ever</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 748px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\" \" title=\"New Spaces will need some taking used to, but they sure look great.

Also the new mouse gestures are pretty fucking awesome. Too many of them to really list, but the one I think I&#8217;m going to appreciate the most is the three finger drag. No more awkward thumb action!</p>\n<p>Now all I need is a mac with an SSD because, to be honest, sometimes things feel a bit slow with all the state saving and things &#8230; not to mention the whole &#8220;Keep windows open when reboot&#8221; that feature painfully needs an SSD.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://drayspencer.wordpress.com/2011/07/05/apple-to-allow-license-free-virtualization-with-os-x-lion-developers-roar-with-delight/\">Apple to allow license-free virtualization with OS X Lion, developers roar with delight</a> (drayspencer.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://tidb.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/os-x-lion/\">OS X Lion</a> (tidb.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://writerway.com/2011/06/30/what-to-do-before-upgrading-your-mac-to-os-x-lion/\">What to do before upgrading your Mac to OS X Lion</a> (writerway.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2011/07/01/os-x-lion-golden-master-seeded-to-developers/\">OS X Lion Golden Master seeded to developers ahead of July launch</a> (9to5mac.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.macstories.net/news/os-x-lion-gm-now-available/\">OS X Lion GM Now Available</a> (macstories.net)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=24dd1167-af88-4f12-a1b9-85557c32b7e7\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5bb60849-9434-54b6-a582-d8be12021df8"}}
