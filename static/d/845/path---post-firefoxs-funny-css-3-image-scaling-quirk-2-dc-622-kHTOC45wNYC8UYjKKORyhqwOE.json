Maybe you were implementing an image gallery and wanted to display thumbnails, maybe you&#8217;ve reimplemented all the scaling algorithms several times.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s surprising how complex something as simple as making sure no dimension is beyond a certain size while maintaining aspect ratio can be. Which is exactly why I wanted to avoid the whole thing this time &#8217;round and let the browser take care of it all.<!--more--></p>\n<p>Should be pretty simple with CSS right?</p>\n<p>Turns out it is, here&#8217;s everything you have to do:</p>\n<pre lang=\"css\">img {\r\n   max-width: 300px;\r\n   max-height: 200px;\r\n}</pre>\n<p>Casting aside concerns such as load times and bandwidth for a moment. This is an elegant solution to a hairy problem. Browsers as it turns out do exactly the right thing &#8211; make sure neither dimension is too big and carefully adjusting the other dimension to maintain aspect ratio.</p>\n<p>But try putting that image into a flexbox div and strange things start happening in firefox.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2642\" style=\"width: 583px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_044.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2642 \" title=\"Flexbox and image scaling in FF\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_044.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"573\" height=\"234\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_044.png 818w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_044-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flexbox and image scaling in FF</p></div>\n<p>What&#8217;s stranger still is that wrapping that same image into a vanilla div with zero styling not only fixes the image resizing issue, but also maintains centering and other flexbox properties you were originally going for.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2643\" style=\"width: 458px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_045.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2643\" title=\"And then it works\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_045.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"448\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_045.png 448w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Selection_045-300x218.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 448px) 100vw, 448px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">And then it works</p></div>\n<p>You can check it out in action <a href=\"http://swizec.com/code/firefox-scaling-quirk.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Not sure exactly what&#8217;s going on here, but  I&#8217;m glad I managed to find a fix for one strange thing among many. Now I have a website full of very <em>very</em> nonsemantic <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"HTML\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML\" rel=\"wikipedia\">HTML</a> simply  because of javascript&#8217;s quirks.</p>\n<p>This brings up memories of times before I decided I don&#8217;t care about IE support anymore &#8230; granted, these features are far from standardized and it&#8217;s therefore to be expected strangeness might appear. But Firefox is not where I expected such problems to crop up.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/09/19/css3-flexible-box-layout-explained/\">CSS3 Flexible Box Layout Explained</a> (coding.smashingmagazine.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.geek.com/articles/gadgets/firefox-for-tablets-tailors-browsing-experience-for-larger-android-displays-20110830/\">Firefox for Tablets tailors browsing experience for larger Android displays</a> (geek.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://codingpython.wordpress.com/2011/09/05/1661/\">10 jQuery Layout Tutorials</a> (codingpython.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=33f22781-c36e-4740-8b6a-4c2adb7d58c4\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"67c01052-2b42-5065-8058-22c3f75ae769"}}
