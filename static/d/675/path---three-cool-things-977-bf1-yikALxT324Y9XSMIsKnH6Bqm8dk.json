{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Three cool things","content":"<p>In lieu of a proper blogpost today you get three cool things, because I have to pass two exams an hour apart.</p>\n<h2>1) Arrivals</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.iamdanw.com/wrote/arrivals-for-foursquare/\" target=\"_blank\">Arrivals</a> is an incredibly cool Foursquare app &#8211; probably the best I have ever seen. The idea is simple, take your foursquare data, turn your friends into aeroplanes, make an arrivals board like at an airport.</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s pretty much it. The app doesn&#8217;t do a whole lot, it runs in a browser and I love it because it does a single thing, but does it perfectly and in a cool way.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\" \" title=\"Arrivals for Foursquare\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/606491964bf311e1abb01231381b65e3_710.jpg\" alt=\"Arrivals for Foursquare\" width=\"490\" height=\"490\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Arrivals for Foursquare</p></div>\n<h2>2) Design for programmers</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://method.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">Method of Action</a> is something I only discovered last night and haven&#8217;t had the chance to play around with that much yet. It looks like a very promising way for programmers (people like me) to learn enough about design to hold their own in a conversation with a designer.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, looks like it will enable us to throw together mockups and to at least understand what designers <em>do</em>. We love ranting on and on about how none of those stupid <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Luser\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luser\" rel=\"wikipedia\">lusers</a> understand what a programmer&#8217;s life is like &#8211; time to reciprocate ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<p>Oh and the <a href=\"http://type.method.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">Kern</a>, <a href=\"http://shape.method.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">Shape</a> and <a href=\"http://color.method.ac/\" target=\"_blank\">Color</a> games are already super fun to play.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_3605\" style=\"width: 695px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-31-at-11.18.29-AM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-3605 \" title=\"Method of Action\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-31-at-11.18.29-AM.png\" alt=\"Method of Action\" width=\"685\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-31-at-11.18.29-AM.png 979w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-31-at-11.18.29-AM-300x129.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 685px) 100vw, 685px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Method of Action</p></div>\n<h2>3) Buffer&#8217;s iOS app</h2>\n<p>My favourite twitter tool <a href=\"http://blog.bufferapp.com/the-complete-guide-to-the-brand-new-buffer-iphone-app\" target=\"_blank\">Buffer has now got an iPhone app</a>. If you don&#8217;t know about Buffer yet, shame on you! It&#8217;s only the tool that played a great role in increasing my blog traffic baseline by roughly 1000% last year. Yes, that&#8217;s a thousand percent.</p>\n<p>Diminishing returns aside, it&#8217;s still a very powerful tool.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 368px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"  \" title=\"Mine was just emptied so the screenshot was lame\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/IMG_01763.png\" alt=\"Mine was just emptied so the screenshot was lame\" width=\"358\" height=\"538\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Mine was just emptied so the screenshot was lame</p></div>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/01/30/arrivals-for-foursquare-displays-check-ins-on-old-style-airport-board/\">Arrivals for Foursquare Displays Check-ins on Old-Style Airport Board</a> (mashable.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/foursquare-update-introduces-radar-for-ios-5/\">News: Foursquare update introduces Radar for iOS 5</a> (ilounge.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/01/30/impending-clear-interview/\">Clear To Do App Has Some Surprising Design Inspirations</a> (mashable.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.lockergnome.com/social/2011/12/05/foursquare-is-a-waste-of-time/\">Foursquare is a Waste of Time</a> (lockergnome.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=7c028505-7458-4a31-8f52-c2ddd33306f7\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c7ee95b-ced4-51f7-b826-ee58013c579d"}}
