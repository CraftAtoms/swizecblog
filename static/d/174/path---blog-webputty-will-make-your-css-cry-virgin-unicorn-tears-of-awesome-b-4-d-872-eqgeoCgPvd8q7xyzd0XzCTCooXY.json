This came mostly from spending a lot of time hanging out with designers.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2011\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-2011\" title=\"GithubFriends\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-11.35.51-AM-300x176.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"176\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-11.35.51-AM-300x176.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-11.35.51-AM-1024x602.png 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-11.35.51-AM.png 1339w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">GithubFriends, the eyesore</p></div>\n<p>I&#8217;ve even gotten so bad as to care about <em>fonts.</em>Â Fonts man! Fonts.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the knowledge of how to implement a design and being able to recognise a good design when you see it isn&#8217;t enough to make you a good designer. The real designers, the one that actually call themselves such, have something extra. That magical voodoo ability to pull a good design out of thin air.</p>\n<p>Similarly to how a developer sees an algorithm before it is implemented, so too does a good designer see his design before the first line is put down in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adobe InDesign\" href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html\" rel=\"homepage\">InDesign</a>.</p>\n<p>So how can a schmuck like me create a website that doesn&#8217;t offend the eye then?<!--more--></p>\n<h2>Enter WebPutty, stage left</h2>\n<p>Barely a week ago <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Fog Creek Software\" href=\"http://www.fogcreek.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Fog Creek Software</a> released their newest tool for us poor schmucks.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a website. That is also an IDE. Made for editing CSS.</p>\n<p>The idea is pretty simple. You can write the CSS and you can see when something looks good. So why not edit the CSS and immediately see whether it looks good or not?</p>\n<p>Right? Right. Brilliant!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what it looks like when I work on my latest pet project, which I will not link to because it is not yet ready for the public (and I&#8217;m too lazy to implement beta locks and whatnot, if you know the url, have at it, leave me feedback ðŸ˜‰</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_2009\" style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2009\" title=\"WebPutty + thefantastic.me\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-28-at-11.42.12-AM-e1311879209766.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"363\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">WebPutty + thefantastic.me</p></div>\n<p>The whole idea is pretty simple. On the left you see the website you&#8217;re working on and on the right is the CSS you&#8217;re editing. Everything you do immediately reflects in the page.</p>\n<p>What makes this arrangement so much better than the traditional InDesign approach is that you can intereact with the site and make sure everything works. Things hidden behind javascript actions can be easily styled and so on. It&#8217;s pretty brilliant.</p>\n<p>Plus, if your site only works on localhost, WebPutty doesn&#8217;t care! It still works ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think my CSS editing workflow has been changed forever.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/07/webputty-browser-based-css-editor.php\">WebPutty: Browser Based CSS Editing Made Easy</a> (readwriteweb.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blog.fogcreek.com/webputty-css-editing-goes-boink/\">WebPutty: CSS editing goes &#8220;boink&#8221;</a> (fogcreek.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.webputty.net/\">Fog Creek releases WebPutty</a> (webputty.net)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=e366686c-293f-4e71-84a1-22fd7cc4b581\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ae918855-babe-5ead-9bdf-08d6012eb405"}}
