{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"In sickness and in death","content":"<p>\n For the past week I have been pestered by a terrible illness that put me in bed for many days. I suffered horrible pains and fevers and what I still claim to be fever-induced hallucinations rather than half crazed dreams and visions. It looked so real!\n</p>\n<p>\n At first the good doctor scared me quite a bit when I was told I had some form of viral tonsil infection that is in fact a saliva transfered STD. The problem there being that since it&#39;s viral it cannot be cured; you simply have to wait it out. Of course suffering an illness out brings along a great deal of trouble, namely pain and apparently, in this case, even up to 50% increase in size of some internal organs like the liver and spleen &#8230; with danger of ruptures. Also I&#39;d be bedridden for a whole fortnight.\n</p>\n<p>\n Luckily for me and my freshly new sex life (no strenuous activity until February in the previously describe eventuality) antibiotics worked and the infection turned out to be a more managable thing that was cured in a few days and I shall be regaining normality tomorrow. Of course I still have to take the pills for as long as they last and I can&#39;t start going to the gym until next week &#8230; and even then slowly ease in &#8230; as if I will. I&#39;m glad I can get back to work and classes because having stayed at home for this long a time I can tell you, it&#39;s not lovely at all.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d9329ce8-d680-5ded-bb22-ecde556daeaa"}}
