{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Girls night and writing","content":"<p>On Friday my lovely lass had a girls night and left me stranded without anything much to do &#8230; so I didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>BUT! After a while I decided to do some writing since this big rush of ideas bubbled into my head, maybe I got smart &#8217;cause I&#8217;m about to have a tumor eat my brain away, and I surprisingly managed to come up with five written pages of stuff, almost without crossing anything out, at Zeleni zajec over a cocktail. It was fun writing that much in one go after an extremely long time of not having been able to write anything of use. So over the last two days I managed to somewhat complete the tale, but put in a little cliffhanger at the end so I can continue this promising story about a dwarf and his wife at some other time.</p>\n<p>I also went to a striptease club where many interesting things happened, but I probably shouldn&#8217;t write much about those experiences in such a public place. The fact that I&#8217;ve gone and that those things are a money pit should suffice. So without further ado, here&#8217;s the first paragraph and the link to <a href=\"http://3pike.org/tales/The_lonely_dwarf.rtf\">The Lonely Dwarf</a>:</p>\n<pre>There was once a dwarf called John who lived in a cottage deep inside the woods with his \r\nwife Melinda. They led a happy existence full of daily little hurdles and exciting moments to\r\nkeep them going.\r\n\r\nTheir cottage wasn&rsquo;t large, in fact you could say it was rather small, and it had \r\neverything they needed. There was a large kitchen, so the dwarf could make his creations in,\r\n a small study for the dwarf and an adjacent library for them both. There was also a large \r\nstudio for Melinda to do her artistical musings in. She never really made anything of use /../</pre>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"51ec1d4e-7b5f-54b8-b5ea-f36aea0c1d8f"}}
