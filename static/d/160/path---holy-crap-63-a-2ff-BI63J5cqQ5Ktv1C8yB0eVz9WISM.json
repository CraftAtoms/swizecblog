Sadly there is also the fact hat the comic hasn&#8217;t been finished yet, mostly because the idea is to produce quality work and there simply hasn&#8217;t been much time to devote to it so it didn&#8217;t get finished. I will do my best to get the issue finished by hte end of the week and then it shall be called the August update.<br />This might seem as a dirty trick I know, but it will enable me to work on the comics for next month rather than rushing to complete comics for this month. That means, I labour all month just as now, but then the update happens in the beginning of the month, pretty good huh.</p>\n<p>Also you mahe have noticed that the webcam on the left hasn&#8217;t been performing it&#8217;s duties, this is because the uploader keeps complaining about some socket error, I have no idea what it&#8217;s nagging on about but it just cannot upload the camera image. Will have to look into fixing that in the immediate future.</p></div>\n</div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c789ef57-ba6d-5c06-856a-b674e75d1d28"}}
