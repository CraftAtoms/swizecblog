Instagram makes mobile photos <em>fast, simple, &amp; beautiful</em>.</p>\n<p>When we sat down three months ago to start designing our product, we looked at <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Digital photography\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">digital photos</a> and realized very few exciting things had happened in the last 5 years. We’re setting out to change that, and this release is our first step along the way.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Just 19 months later, on April 9th, 2012 (yesterday), a new piece of news came along</p>\n<blockquote><p>When Mike and I started Instagram nearly two years ago, we set out to change and improve the way the world communicates and shares. We’ve had an amazing time watching Instagram grow into a vibrant community of people from all around the globe. Today, we couldn’t be happier to announce that Instagram has agreed to be acquired by <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Facebook\" href=\"http://facebook.com\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As an <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Early adopter\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">early adopter</a>, I was along for the ride almost since the very beginning &#8211; my first instagram photo going online on November 5th, 2010. Yes, I&#8217;m an Instagram fanboy! And<em> I feel included</em> in the success because I&#8217;ve been rooting for them so long.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s just put that billion dollar acquisition into perspective:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>45 million dollars</em> for every month worked on Instagram</li>\n<li><em>76 million dollars</em> per employee (just 13 of them according to Wikipedia)</li>\n<li>about <em>30 dollars</em> for every user</li>\n<li>about <em>a dollar</em> for every photo</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And <strong>that</strong> is what startups are about. Creating value. <em>Ridiculous amounts</em> of value.</p>\n<p>For even more perspective &#8211; if your average university education was providing as much value as Instagram does for both its founders and its users &#8230; someone would have to dump <em>3.2 billion dollars</em> in your lap as a graduation gift.</p>\n<p>Some of you might be wondering what&#8217;s so special about Instagram anyway, how can they command such a high valuation, what to users see in them?</p>\n<p>To that, all I can say is &#8230; remember what sharing a photo was like before Instagram? All that uploading to a twitpic service, then posting to twitter and to facebook and whatever &#8230; it was a pain in the arse.</p>\n<p>More importantly, filters are just about the only way you can make a mobile photo look any better than a bland piece of crap with poor lighting. And as a faithful Instagram fan, I&#8217;m sticking by this interpretation.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.androidauthority.com/facebook-will-buy-instagram-for-1billion-dollars-breaking-news-73899/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook will buy Instagram for $1Billion Dollars [Breaking News]</a> (androidauthority.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://progressivemediaconcepts.com/2012/04/facebook-acquires-instagram-for-1-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Acquires Instagram for $1 Billion</a> (progressivemediaconcepts.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.macrumors.com/2012/04/09/facebook-buys-instagram-for-1-billion/\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook Buys Instagram For $1 Billion</a> (macrumors.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=70289ca6-3204-4e92-96ee-7ccb9373ab9d\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a8887c05-ee57-54e4-934f-3c9e692956ca"}}
