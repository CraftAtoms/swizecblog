This weekâ€™s posts will serve as a sort of report of what I got up to the previous day instead of the usual schedule â€“ wish me luck that I achieve even half of what Iâ€™d like to.</em></p>\n<div style=\"width: 242px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/13757887@N00/5479666205\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Data Points\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/5479666205_e74e748bf0_m3.jpg\" alt=\"Data Points\" width=\"232\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image by Voxphoto via Flickr</p></div>\n<p>As I sit here slowly sipping on my tea I realize it may have been an incredibly bad idea to stay up until 8am trying to convince <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Haskell (programming language)\" href=\"http://haskell.org\" rel=\"homepage\">Haskell</a>that I really honestly don&#8217;t care about types as much as it seems to.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s really quite funny how weird a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Type system\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system\" rel=\"wikipedia\">statically typed language</a> feels after many years of dynamic languages. <em>Yes, I know, this is a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Number\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Numerical</a> and that is a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point\" target=\"_blank\">Double</a>, figure it the fuck out man! It&#8217;s not that difficult!</em>Â You&#8217;d think the hardest part about Haskell would be that it is incredibly strict about the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Functional programming\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\" rel=\"wikipedia\">functional programming</a>Â thing, but no, here I am, having trouble with the most basic of concepts.</p>\n<p>But! I prevailed!</p>\n<p>I had in my hands <a href=\"https://github.com/Swizec/Personal-Runway/blob/master/implementation/window.hs\" target=\"_blank\">a lovely algorithm</a> that can in theory perform rudimentary predictions of how my spending is going to behave in the next few days. Â During my morning exercise I realized the implementation doesn&#8217;t actually do what I think it does, but hey, at least I have the algorithm figured out ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>The idea is really quite simple:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Smoothen data with a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Moving average\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average\" rel=\"wikipedia\">rolling average</a> (a 7 day window seems to produce the nicest curve)</li>\n<li>The first unknown <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Data point\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point\" rel=\"wikipedia\">data point</a> is simply the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Expected value\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\" rel=\"wikipedia\">expected value</a> (weighed average) of the last few points</li>\n<li>Expand weighed average window to include the new data point</li>\n<li>Calculate next one</li>\n<li>Repeat for as long as it makes sense &#8211; the more into the future you go, the more wrong you are</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After reading a bunch of papers on data mining time series yesterday I realized that I&#8217;m thinking way too much into this. Sure <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Support vector machine\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine\" rel=\"wikipedia\">SVM</a>&#8216;s are the best at predicting financial time series and people have extremely good results with backpropagation neural networks &#8211; somehow &#8211; but I honestly don&#8217;t need this complexity. I&#8217;m just making a simple tool for myself and it&#8217;s more important to have <em>some</em>Â result than the <em>optimal</em>Â result.</p>\n<p>And either way, according to the papers a neural network is only marginally better than the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Sliding window protocol\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window_protocol\" rel=\"wikipedia\">sliding window</a> approach, and even then only when you&#8217;re dealing with data when far-away points have a lot of impact on the future and/or there is a lot of repetition &#8211; none of which happens here.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2011/12/27/Type-Systems\">Type-System Criteria</a> (tbray.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/sabbatical-week-day-2-i-fail-at-octave/swizec/3282\">Sabbatical week day 2: I fail at Octave</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/learning-me-a-haskell/swizec/3272\">Learning me a Haskell</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://ringingtrue.net/2011/12/27/non-sabbatical/\">Non-Sabbatical</a> (ringingtrue.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8178445/how-to-insert-a-file-to-an-image-datatype-in-sql-server-2005\">How to insert a file to an Image datatype in sql2005</a> (stackoverflow.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=ce282cd2-9d04-4814-b93d-219c7e073a5d\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a8e4b6b1-bab9-52b2-b515-df4b19c1ba5f"}}
