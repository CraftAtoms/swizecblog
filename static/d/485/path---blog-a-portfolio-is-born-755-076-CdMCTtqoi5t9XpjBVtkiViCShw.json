Most say this helps in finding employers and blahblahblah.</p>\n<p>For me having such a page is all about knowing what I&#8217;ve worked on because I&#8217;ve noticed there is just so much stuff I can&#8217;t for the life of me remember everything when I want to and just end up listing random things off the top of my head. This is obviously bad.</p>\n<p>Another reason why I wanted to create such a page was to have a place to store the art I occasionally do because a lot of it has simply vanished into history &#8230; not in the least bit due to my destructive nature of often destroying things I deem unworthy of being remembered. All of the poetry I&#8217;ve ever written has thus vanished into oblivion one day, all 90 pages of it.</p>\n<p>If you turn your attention towards the <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/projects-portfolio\"><strong>portfolio</strong></a>, you will notice that there are some things really unworthy of mention in there, specifically true of the first two webcomics and Urbanislovar, but I felt they are ultimately an important piece of who I am and are thus included for completenes&#8217; sake.</p>\n<p>Anywho, it was fun creating this thing even if it did take four hours last night. The sheer amount of stuff I&#8217;ve done dumbfounds me &#8230; where&#8217;d my life go? Where is all the partying? The crack and hos? I&#8217;m gonna have an incredibly fun midlife crysis in a few decades won&#8217;t I?</p>\n<p>Oh and by the way, <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/projects-portfolio\">Cthulhu and other crazies</a>, the webcomic that gave its name to this blog and was the sole reason swizec.com even exists today has been fully backed up to the portfolio ðŸ™‚ I actually think this one was almost good, the writing was a bit stiff and the drawing a bit lame, but I like it anyway &#8230; might eventually continue.</p>\n<p>PS: the best thing about that Cthulhu webcomic is the technology style I invented, this was before I&#8217;d ever heard of steampunk and notice how it adopts the same kind of features? Futuristic history, love it. Seriously, have a look at those 8 pages or so of comic, you&#8217;ll breeze through it. Unlike myself who spent around 60 to 80 hours making each page &#8230;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4943657f-b05e-5608-a118-34d721e039cf"}}
