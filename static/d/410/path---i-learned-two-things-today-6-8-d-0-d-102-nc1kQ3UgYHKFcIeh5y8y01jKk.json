Now I don&#8217;t have enough data points to know exactly and for certain that it doesn&#8217;t work, but finding such a place in <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"San Francisco\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=37.7793,-122.4192&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=37.7793,-122.4192 (San%20Francisco)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\">San Francisco</a> at what I&#8217;m told is the height of  the tourist season &#8230; well it doesn&#8217;t work. I tried to find hostels, but all online things said nobody had any vacancies. I also tried <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Airbnb\" href=\"http://www.airbnb.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Airbnb</a> and didn&#8217;t even get a response &#8230; tried <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"CouchSurfing\" href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.org/\" rel=\"homepage\">couch surfing</a> and also didn&#8217;t get a response.</p>\n<p>Hell, I even tried to beg the twitters for a couch to crash on for the night and there were no takers. Nobody wants to host for a guest that&#8217;s coming at 4am and staying until about 8am &#8230; possibly drunk out of his mind &#8230;</p>\n<p>What was the other thing that I learned &#8230; I know it was something useful, but I can&#8217;t think of it for the life of me. So I&#8217;m going to go with having learnt that there is a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Starbucks\" href=\"http://Starbucks.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Starbucks</a> open all night in San Francisco and this means I have somewhere to &#8220;stay&#8221; until the trains  start running again at 8am.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/i-learned-two-things-today-2-8/swizec/2059\">I learned two things today 2.8.</a> (swizec.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/08/06/EDJM1KIINF.DTL\">Tourists return to San Francisco</a> (sfgate.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=52252ce6-aede-483b-9135-7208b9b338bc\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e0475d8d-e9e2-5bc9-803e-4b0ade06a11e"}}
