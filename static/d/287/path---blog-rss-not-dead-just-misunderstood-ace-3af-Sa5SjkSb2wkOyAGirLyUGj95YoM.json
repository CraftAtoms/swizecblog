Signs of great decay left and right, let&#8217;s abandon the poor thing completely and let it die in peace right?</p>\n<p>But there is one very very important thing that everybody is missing: RSS is not a user-facing technology. Just like the <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/semantic_web\" title=\"Semantic Web\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://semanticweb.org\">semantic web</a>, it was never meant to be something people actually <em>use</em>.</p>\n<p>RSS is essentially one big hack, a pretty good way of having content delivered to you without specifically going out there and looking for it. Even though, essentially, that&#8217;s exactly what your RSS reader does. It&#8217;s got a list of websites it checks every so often and then gets back to you with the results. In that regard it&#8217;s essentially a bunch of bookmarks, you&#8217;re just not tending to them yourself. It&#8217;s just a bit easier for a computer to read xml than a website. With pubsubhubbub the way this is done has changed a little, but no biggie.</p>\n<p>Ok, so RSS is a content distribution technology for computers.</p>\n<p>Now, we all know that as technologies go, there needs to be that one killer feature that trumps all alternatives right?</p>\n<p>Well twitter&#8217;s got one, the <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/communications_protocol\" title=\"Communications protocol\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol\">communication protocol</a> is dead simple, simpler than phones. Great!</p>\n<p>And facebook&#8217;s got one too, they&#8217;re a bit of everything, not very simple, but everyone&#8217;s got a facebook so you&#8217;re not leaving any time soon because you&#8217;re locked. Great!</p>\n<p>What does RSS have?</p>\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s got geeks. Lots and lots and lots of hardcore geeks. Did you know geeks produce the most content on <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/social_network\" title=\"Social network\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network\">social networks</a>? How do you think stuff gets on your twitter and your facebook? Somebody&#8217;s got to post it there before it can go viral. That someone likely found out via RSS. Sure this can be automated, but then you&#8217;ve just ruined the most important part of consuming content via twitter or facebook &#8211; the social filtering.</p>\n<p>But there&#8217;s an even more important feature to RSS.</p>\n<p><strong>Infinite scalability. Infinite distributability.</strong></p>\n<p>Both twitter and facebook are tied to a single provider. Twitter&#8217;s servers go down and all you see is a failwhale. No content for you. Imagine, for example, a huge earthquake hits california. Now suddenly both twitter&#8217;s and facebook&#8217;s <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/data_center\" title=\"Data center\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center\">data centers</a> are offline. No content.</p>\n<p>But RSS would bravely go on working perfectly. Some sites might not be able to update, but the rest of the world wouldn&#8217;t even notice a glitch. Everything just works smoothly.</p>\n<p>Basically I guess what I&#8217;m saying is the same as <a href=\"http://scripting.com/stories/2010/09/13/howToRebootRss.html\">Dave Winer</a>. RSS is here to stay, <a href=\"http://lazyreadr.com/\">somebody</a> just needs to step up to the plate and make an RSS reader for <em>people.</em></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles by Zemanta</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://gigaom.com/2010/09/13/no-rss-is-not-dead-and-neither-are-rss-readers/\">No, RSS Is Not Dead, and Neither Are RSS Readers</a> (gigaom.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://scobleizer.com/2010/09/13/reboot-rss-readers-sorry-that-train-has-left-the-station/\">Loic Le Meur, CEO of Seesmic, and I were arguing last week about whether RSS has a future or not.
