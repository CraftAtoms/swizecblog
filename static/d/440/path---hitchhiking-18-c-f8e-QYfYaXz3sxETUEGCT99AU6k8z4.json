{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Hitchhiking","content":"<p>A few days ago, on Thursday to be precise, I stepped into the magnificent bookstore thing I usually go to in order to get my fix and there it was, waiting for me, the book I had ordered, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">The Ultimat Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide</span>. It&#8217;s an amazingly well written book with lots of funny little twists and turns and it even makes one laugh a lot. This edition supposedly has 5 novels and a story inside&#8230; so that&#8217;s quite some reading material. 800 pages worth in fact.</p>\n<p>On the other hand there is mister Cthulhu, he has been calmly waiting under my bed to get another issue published and I assure you I am working full steam on it&#8230; well almost, I do take way too many breaks, anyway the issue is progressing and is turning out quite lovely. So just remain patient eh.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"dfab810e-5ad6-5cb0-9aea-a1b0a85b9e7e"}}
