And pimp &#8217;em out, get votes!</p>\n<p>When the hacking carnage begins the highest voted ideas will be gathered up and teams will start working on them. You are also welcome to come put your arse where your mouth is and help make the idea happen, just so you know.</p>\n<p>Then, when the carnage is over, there will be a demoday. Each team will present their idea in front of a bunch of business people and the likes, although personally I&#8217;m all for making them public and creating a huge party where everyone is invited. Hell, a barcamp. Hmm &#8230; yeah, I&#8217;ll convince everyone that that&#8217;s the way it should be done.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, the demo day, then whomever is the best gets heaps upon heaps upon shitloads of bragging rights. They have essentially just become the awesomest dudes in the whole of Europe. That&#8217;s right, if you&#8217;re too much of a pussy to even participate in this thing you&#8217;re a de facto loser. Turn in your hacking license at once. You aren&#8217;t worthy of calling yourself a hacker.</p>\n<p>Also, while you&#8217;re reading this, why not go ahead and vote for the three ideas I contributed ðŸ˜›</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://summerinabasement.uservoice.com/forums/59903-ideas-and-projects/suggestions/835095-web-cheaper-than-beowulf-cluster?ref=title\" target=\"_blank\">Cheaper-than-beowulf cluster</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://summerinabasement.uservoice.com/forums/59903-ideas-and-projects/suggestions/834765-mobile-smart-ipad-rss-reader?ref=title\">Smart RSS reader for iPad</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://summerinabasement.uservoice.com/forums/59903-ideas-and-projects/suggestions/841441-mobile-web-mood-music?ref=title\" target=\"_blank\">Mood music</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh and do pass this around, the more crazy ideas people contribute the merrier ðŸ™‚</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=e0a5ac72-c0d8-450c-bbdd-aea80e892dfd\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e70c5525-efb9-5618-9a29-cdff533ca840"}}
