{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"London 5","content":"<p>\nOh but I have been neglecting you my lovelies haven&#39;t I? It&#39;s all for a good reason and I should be able to apologize, but you know, I don&#39;t do that. So let&#39;s just get on with it as if I did post on each day of the last three.\n</p>\n<p>\nYesterday I went to see Cabaret with the loveliest of things last night. I&#39;m not quite certain because of which the evening was the best I&#39;ve ever had, but let&#39;s, for my own safety, say it was because of the play. The young thing is taken after all and I&#39;m a man of honour.\n</p>\n<p>\nCabaret was probably the best live performance I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. It was just marvelously magnificent and I suggest everyone to go and watch it. You must! There&#39;s a lot of singing and dancing and even quite some nudity, both male and female, but us theatre goers find that rather normal by now. Nudity everywhere. I laughed almost the whole evening away and I will most assuredly go see the slovene version when I come home.\n</p>\n<p>\nThe lovely young thing I mentioned was Peaches, my long time chatslave person from england and I have to admit meeting her would be more awkward, but it all went as if we&#39;d been long time real life buddies who just so happened not to have seen each other in two days. Really, there&#39;s more awkwardnes meeting my buddies after a week or two.\n</p>\n<p>\nShould&#39;ve taken a photo &#8230;</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c1292516-18fc-5a98-8ce5-ded45cfb32c8"}}
