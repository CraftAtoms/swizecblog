I&#8217;ve been using <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Klok\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://klok.mcgraphix.com/klok/index.htm\">Klok</a>, an AIR based desktop thingy, for quite a while now and it&#8217;s getting a bit lame. Development has stopped some insanely long time ago and certain features are simply missing &#8230; like for example syncing between devices.</p>\n<p>Naturally as any good twitter addict would do, my first reaction upon deciding this was to open the nearest twitter client and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/Swizec/status/77348484377878528\" target=\"_blank\">ask</a> for the best time tracking software. I expected the usual; most people ignoring me like I don&#8217;t exist, one or two retweeting the question and perhaps a few people telling me their personal favourite or at least someone trolling me that I&#8217;m an idiot and why would I need something like that.</p>\n<p>What happened was a lot stranger. Instead of the usual random people telling me their opinions, I got five tweets from businesses telling me to give their solution a try.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 556px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Yanomo was first\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bnJLr3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"546\" height=\"186\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Yanomo was first</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 511px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Paymo was soon after\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/DILnH3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"501\" height=\"154\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Paymo was soon after</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 468px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"I still read Apollo's tweet\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mj6ki3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"458\" height=\"214\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I still read Apollo&#39;s tweet</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 541px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Fanurio was so late it just felt like spam\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/uoQke2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"531\" height=\"186\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Fanurio was so late it just felt like spam</p></div>\n<div style=\"width: 519px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Replicon was so hopelessly late I didn't even notice the tweet\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hZEh52.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"509\" height=\"216\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Replicon was so hopelessly late I didn&#39;t even notice the tweet</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Being a spoiled twitter user that I am, I clicked the first two links that got to me. And I even researched both products. I signed up for Yanomo and it looked pretty damn good, almost perfect, but it didn&#8217;t have a key feature I wanted &#8211; a timer to time when I&#8217;m working on things. It needs to have times inserted manually.</p>\n<p>By the time Paymo came along my mind still quite wasn&#8217;t made up because of the missing feature, so they got me to click their link, check out the product and take a few very hard moments of consideration. Their problem was that everything I read, everything I saw, was immediately compared to Yanomo whereas Yanomo only had to compare against the old solution I was trying to ditch.</p>\n<p>The other guys came in a bit late, the latest was even a whole three days late and that&#8217;s just obscenely too much. By that time my mind had already been made up and I was giving Yanomo a real test to see if it pans out for me or I&#8217;m going to have to search for something else.</p>\n<p>In fact, most of the other responses felt like spam. Upon seeing them my mind instantly filtered them out because all I could see was that somebody was pitching a product to me, it didn&#8217;t even cross my mind that but 40 hours earlier I was asking about the very same thing! It just didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>In the end I chose Yanomo, which I&#8217;ll be using henceforth to track my billable hours and stuff &#8230; I&#8217;ll still be using Klok the same way I&#8217;m using it now &#8211; to track every productive-ish hour of my life, but which isn&#8217;t exactly billable.</p>\n<p>There are two main reasons why I made the choice that I did:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A very friendly and very quick tweet</li>\n<li>The product just looks and feels easy to use</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So there you have it, getting to your end user quickly and with something pretty, may well mean they&#8217;ll choose you over the competition even if you&#8217;re missing the single most important feature.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://socialb2p.com/2011/06/05/are-you-spittering-spamming-or-truly-engaging-on-twitter/\">Are you spittering (=spamming) or truly engaging on Twitter?</a> (socialb2p.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://dorai.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/my-ideal-twitter-client/\">My Ideal Twitter Client</a> (dorai.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.getklok.com/\">Free Time Tracking Software &#8211; Klok Free and Klok Pro</a> (getklok.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=690fc9f9-6717-4a8d-8202-363dd2b20995\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"909192ac-f0b9-5f1a-8ead-b0e13742b9fa"}}
