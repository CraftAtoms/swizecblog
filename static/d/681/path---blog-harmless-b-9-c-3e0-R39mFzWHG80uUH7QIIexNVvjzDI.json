{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Harmless?","content":"<p>Firstly, as you may have noticed the comic is still not up even after I promised for it to be in its rightful position of being up. This is due to many reasons, one is that I now effectively have two jobs, one full time and one part time&#8230; moneys are important. Another reason is that the computer all of the work is done on decided to be a downright bastard and have a disk fault right where all the panels were, or at least most of them, so I ended up having to redo a big part of the comic&#8230; which I am now in the process of redoing as fast as possible.</p>\n<p>Now that that&#8217;s out of the way, today a great and quiet awesome video has been found by a member of the <a href=\"http://cad-forums.com\">CAD</a> forums and that video&#8230; shows how one can manipulate time. Of course it&#8217;s not really time manipualtion but it does have the same effect. How to make the device, how to use it and what it actually does is greatly explained on the <a href=\"http://cre.ations.net/creation/44\">website</a>. You really should go and have a look, <a href=\"http://cre.ations.net/creation/44\">it&#8217;s</a> worth it.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5a4c8fd7-4d7b-5aed-b45c-024cca3f33d5"}}
