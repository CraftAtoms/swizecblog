{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Why I won&#8217;t be switching to VSCode any time soon","content":"<p>Tried VSCode last night, spent 18 minutes yak shaving my config, couldn&#8217;t make it visually pleasant, moved back to Emacs. Everyone raves about VSCode, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a great editor/IDE, but it&#8217;s just not for me.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m holding it wrong. You tell me. I <em>want</em> to give it another chance.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what I didn&#8217;t like ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<p>In Emacs, I use the Tomorrow theme, I think. My coding OS (that&#8217;s an old timey joke, btw) looks like this.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7894\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emacs-1.png\" width=\"656\" height=\"957\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emacs-1.png 656w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/emacs-1-206x300.png 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px\" />\n<p>There&#8217;s not much going on, and I like that. The code looks pleasant, the background is white. Nothing to the left or right of the code.</p>\n<p>The window header tells me my file&#8217;s full path, and there&#8217;s a narrow strip of file tabs. Tabs filter based on file mode so when I&#8217;m in JavaScript, I only see JavaScript files, in Ruby only Ruby, in CSS only CSS, etc. This is neat when you&#8217;re working on large projects with many different file types.</p>\n<p>At the bottom, you have a small command line. This is where my <em>&#8220;Find open file using fuzzy search&#8221;</em> lives. Makes it easy to navigate when there are 50 different files open. You can use it to fuzzy search un-open files too.</p>\n<p>I rarely close my editor and often forget to close files.</p>\n<p>Also at the bottom, you have a git indicator that tells you which branch you&#8217;re on, whether the current file is dirty, which mode you&#8217;re in, etc.</p>\n<h2>VSCode â€“ visual clutter</h2>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what that same file looks like in VSCode.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7893\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-1.png\" width=\"922\" height=\"955\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-1.png 922w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-1-290x300.png 290w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-1-768x795.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px\" />\n<p>Using the same (I think?) Tomorrow light theme, but it feels less clean. It feels like too many colors pop, and the font looks less pleasant.</p>\n<p>This is just habit, however. I could get used to it quick.</p>\n<p>What I don&#8217;t like is all the visual cruft that VSCode puts on my window.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s the weird gigantic scrollbar they took from Sublime. Why do I need a zoomed out version of my file cluttering up my view?</p>\n<p>The tabs are also bigger, and there&#8217;s buttons top right that I think should exist solely as keyboard shortcuts. Two of them (the find and the 3 dots) don&#8217;t do anything. The split view is nice, maybe.</p>\n<p>On the bottom, you have basically the same information that my Emacs provides, but on a brighter poppier background. I think that makes it look distracting.</p>\n<p>My code should be the most visually pronounced part of my editor. Not my editor&#8217;s tools.</p>\n<p>To the left, we have an atrocity: A project explorer.</p>\n<p>Yes, you can close it. Then VSCode looks like this ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7896\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-2.png\" width=\"925\" height=\"954\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-2.png 925w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-2-291x300.png 291w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-2-768x792.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 925px) 100vw, 925px\" />\n<p>Better, but still cluttered. <em>grump</em></p>\n<h2>VSCode â€“Â &#8220;project explorer&#8221;</h2>\n<p>Fundamentally what I don&#8217;t like about the concept of a &#8220;project explorer&#8221; is that it promotes the concept of adding projects to your editor. They clutter up for years and why does my editor care anyway?</p>\n<p>Yes, to give me helpful search functions and code explanations and stuff. All of that is great.</p>\n<p>But it&#8217;s also implicit.</p>\n<p>Emacs looks at your current directory and provides fuzzy search through files within. VSCode takes a whole directory tree and provides fuzzy search.</p>\n<p>That might be better. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve seen my coworkers have fun times when they try to open <code>index.js</code> and their IDE helpfully suggests 50 different <code>index.js</code> files.</p>\n<p>Are we meant to have unique filenames throughout our project? Then what&#8217;s the point of structuring it in directories at all?</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the uncloseable toolbar to the left.</p>\n<p>Why does the <code>Extensions</code> button have to always be visible? How often do people fiddle with their extensions?</p>\n<p>Why is <code>Search</code> always there? Should be just a shortcut everyone learns within 3min of using an editor.</p>\n<p>The debugger is nice.</p>\n<p>Why do I need source control stuff right there always bugging me?</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7897\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-3.png\" width=\"289\" height=\"286\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-3.png 289w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-3-125x125.png 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" />\n<p>Why is it trying to show stuff from multiple git repos at the same time? I&#8217;m only working on one project, yo.</p>\n<p>Actually, that might be my bad. I seem to have run <code>git init</code> on my home directory at some point. Now VSCode thinks everything is a project and gets confused.</p>\n<p>It also complains that 5000+ unstaged files might be too much.</p>\n<p>Emacs wouldn&#8217;t even think about poking that. Doesn&#8217;t think about projects you see. Oh, you&#8217;re in a file? Here you go. Oh ,you want to search the directory? Sure.</p>\n<h2>VSCode â€“Â trying to be too helpful</h2>\n<p>And then there&#8217;s this stuff. It tries to be helpful and I&#8217;m sure for some people it works really well and helps a lot.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7891\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-4.png\" width=\"317\" height=\"156\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-4.png 317w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-4-300x148.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px\" />\n<p>Thank you, VSCode. I had no idea that <code>&lt;Promises&gt;</code> was a JSX element. Very helpful advice right there.</p>\n<p>And <code>key=\"\"</code> is an attribute! How wonderful, I never would have guessed.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7892\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-5.png\" width=\"328\" height=\"140\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-5.png 328w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-5-300x128.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px\" />\n<p>Maybe I&#8217;m holding it wrong. Maybe in bigger contexts, this is super useful, or maybe I need TypeScript to make it shine.</p>\n<p>Right now, it&#8217;s just annoying that I have to be super careful about where I put my mouse lest some tiny popup pops up and obstructs my code.</p>\n<p>I guess the <code>Peek Definition</code> option is nice. But whose fingers are stretchy enough to press alt-F12 comfortably?</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7895\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-6.png\" width=\"657\" height=\"457\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-6.png 657w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/vscode-6-300x209.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 657px) 100vw, 657px\" />\n<p>Yeah, I can see that being useful in a large codebase.</p>\n<p>Oh, and VSCode does that annoying thing where you write a <code>(</code> and it adds a <code>)</code>. I&#8217;ve always found that infuriating ever since the first editors started doing it in the early aughts. Stop that.</p>\n<p>At the same time, it doesn&#8217;t autocomplete HTML and JSX tags. I got used to typing <code>&lt;/</code> and Emacs automatically closing my open tag. That is nice, but VSCode doesn&#8217;t do it.</p>\n<p>Maybe there&#8217;s a plugin I&#8217;m missing?</p>\n<h2>Why I&#8217;m not switching yet</h2>\n<p>Habit.</p>\n<p>VSCode has plenty of features that my Emacs setup does not. It&#8217;s a great editor, and I can see myself growing to like it.</p>\n<p>But it just doesn&#8217;t offer any killer features to make me invest the time to get over the little niggles that annoy me.</p>\n<p>Unless you can suggest plugins I&#8217;m missing to fix those? <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=.@swizec's%20VSCode%20opinion%20is%20dumb%20because:  https://swizec.com/blog/wont-be-switching-vscode/swizec/7898\">Shout at me on Twitter</a>.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"64de00ce-086c-525b-bd1e-9bcebf88fd2e"}}
