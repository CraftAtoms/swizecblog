YASSSS.</p>\n<p>Get off the internets so you can focus on things you enjoy? YASSS.</p>\n<p>Block that addictive shit if you have to? OMAIGOD YASSS.</p>\n<p>Train people that you&#8217;re flakey in communication and never to expect a prompt reply? YASSS.</p>\n<p>Batch meetings into chunks and avoid as many as you can in the first place? YAS!</p>\n<p>Schedule long swathes of uninterrupted time, and lock yourself in a cabin if you have to? OMAIGOD YES PLEASE.</p>\n<p>Say No to as many opportunities as you can because they&#8217;re a distraction from what you really want to do? YES!</p>\n<p>Schedule every last moment of your time so you always have a game plan? Yes, great idea, but I prefer routines because I&#8217;m bad at scheduling.</p>\n<p>Take five minutes at the start of the day and at its end to go over your priorities and close any running mental loops? OMAIGOD YAS.</p>\n<p>Ask your boss, <em>&#8220;Is my job to Do The Work or to be available to coworkers&#8217; whims&#8221;</em>? I&#8217;ve been meaning to, but I&#8217;m afraid of the answer ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>When inspiration strikes, clear your schedule, focus on that shit. Don&#8217;t let it go. OMAIGOD YASS</p>\n<p>Schedule regular time to reflect and to think without distraction? FUCK YES (this is why I run)</p>\n<p>Basically, it&#8217;s an amazing book, and I cannot do it justice. I listened to it as an audiobooks and now I want to buy like fifty copies and give them to everyone I know. Maaaybe I&#8217;ll do that but probably not because that would be expensive ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>Outside the practical advice he gives on <em>how</em> to do these things that he suggests you should do, I enjoyed the results. The guy went from publishing 2 academic papers per year as a freeloading student to publishing 9 academic papers <em>and writing Deep Work</em> <strong>while competing for tenure</strong>. All in one year.</p>\n<p>Holy shit, dude.</p>\n<p>He does admit that it was too tiring and he&#8217;s going to chillax a little. Maybe publish only 8 papers while writing another book. ðŸ˜€</p>\n<p>I want to say there&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t like about the book, but there isn&#8217;t. The whole thing was great. You should read it.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"346a1076-9e9e-52c9-9d73-cc7a09be9e9f"}}
