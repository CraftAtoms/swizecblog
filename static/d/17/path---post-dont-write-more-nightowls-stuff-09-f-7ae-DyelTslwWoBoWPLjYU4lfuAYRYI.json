{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Why I don&#8217;t write more Nightowls type stuff","content":"<blockquote><p>\nYo dude! I used to love your emails, and now they&#39;re full of self-aggrandizing promotional bullshit. What the hell happened? No wonder your open rates are dropping, nobody wants to read this crap.\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>This is the email I sometimes get. I paraphrase, but the gist is that way back when they first subscribed, my emails were deep and meaningful. Now they&#39;re… less so.</p>\n<p>You are correct, dear reader. My emails used to be more deep and meaningful. You subscribed to an email list that shot off from my <a href=\"http://nightowlsbook.com/\">Nightowls book</a> – <em>Why Programmers Work at Night</em>.</p>\n<p>It&#39;s invariably someone from that list.</p>\n<p>They subscribed to my writing about life as a programmer, working in teams, burnout, interesting quirks of psychology, tips on productivity, and inspiration for engineers. Now they get my technical writing because technical is most of the writing that I do.</p>\n<p>This is upsetting. I understand. I, too, would be upset.</p>\n<img src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-348323-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7537\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-348323-1024x576.jpeg 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-348323-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/pexels-photo-348323-768x432.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n<p>I loved writing those emails. I loved writing that content. It&#39;s a great venue for writing things that are true. When I say true, I don&#39;t mean factual. I mean something more. A <em>true</em> truth.</p>\n<p>Those are things that weigh on my mind for weeks, sometimes months. Things that percolate and gestate before they&#39;re ready. Or sometimes things that happen and upset me.</p>\n<p>That&#39;s when those things get me in trouble.</p>\n<p>I write those things with gusto, and it shows. People respond. People feel. People come back. It makes them connect, commiserate, cheer, and applaud. Good emotional stuff. The best.</p>\n<p>But let me tell you something else that is true.</p>\n<p>I can&#39;t write more of those things. I don&#39;t have the firepower.  I lack the emotional stamina.</p>\n<p>That stuff is true writing. It works only when it is true. When the author steps up to the page and bleeds, that&#39;s when it hits. When people love it. When it makes you <em>feel</em>.</p>\n<p>When it is not that, it falls flat. The writing becomes derivative dreck. Just another bullshit thing trying to inspire you. A productivity hack like all others. Armchair psychology with little understanding.</p>\n<p>By now, I have started, kept going, and stopped three or four different Nightowls blogs. Invariably, I run out of steam, run out of life experience, and I stop. The book lies unfinished because I don&#39;t feel man enough to complete it.</p>\n<p>Maybe I&#39;ve just lost the piss and vinegar of youth. Who am I to give you advice about life? What do I know…</p>\n<p>The same things that worked for me 6 years ago still work for me today. Get your workout, eat good calories, spend time alone, drink caffeine, make stuff. What else is there to say?</p>\n<p>Now, technical writing. That stuff&#39;s fun. There&#39;s always something new to discover, something new to play with. You get an idea, you work on it, you forget to sleep, sometimes to eat. A few hours later, you have something cool to show to the world. So you write about it. Hit publish and people love it because it&#39;s cool and fun.</p>\n<p>So here is another thing that is true.</p>\n<p>That Nightowls book, it sold 2449 copies for a total of $6215 in 4 years (since 2013-03-18). It took me over 3 years to gain 900 or so email subscribers.</p>\n<p>My technical stuff, React &amp; D3 in particular, that sold 2260 copies in 2 years (since 2015-03-16). $53,000 in revenue if you count workshops. 8,000 or so email subscribers.</p>\n<p>Nightowls content is art. It makes people feel. Technical content solves problems. It helps people become better engineers. Writing helps <em>me</em> become a better engineer!</p>\n<p>So I&#39;m sorry, dear reader. I know you&#39;re upset, but I&#39;m going to keep publishing the self-aggrandizing technical bullshit. Sometimes, when it feels right, I still publish Nightowls-type stuff.</p>\n<p>Have you seen the latest few?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/coding-more-fun-engineering/swizec/7120\">Why coding is more fun than engineering</a>, October 2016</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/go-fuck-home/swizec/7139\">Go the fuck home</a>, October 2016</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/did-an-ama-wasnt-crickets/swizec/7153\">I did an AMA and it wasn&#39;t crickets</a>, October 2016</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/only-self-help-business-advice-you-need/swizec/7190\">These 19 Words are the Only Self-Help &amp; Business Advice You Need</a>, November 2016</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/filter-bubbles-echo-chambers/swizec/7205\">Let&#39;s talk about filter bubbles</a>, November 2016</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/learned-6x-income-4-years/swizec/7340\">What I learned while 6x-ing my income in 4 years</a>, January 2017</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/nights-weekends/swizec/7394\">Nights and weekends</a>, January 2017</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/trouble-vacation/swizec/7463\">The trouble with vacation</a>, March 2017</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The content <em>you</em> love happens and will continue to happen.
