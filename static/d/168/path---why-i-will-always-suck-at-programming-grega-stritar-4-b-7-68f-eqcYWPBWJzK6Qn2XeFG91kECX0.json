{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Why I will always suck at programming [Grega Stritar]","content":"<p>I&#8217;ve been actively <strong>coding for 15 years now</strong>, ever since I&#8217;ve discovered the Interwebs. If you count in the lectures I took for <a title=\"ZX Spectrum - Wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum\" target=\"_blank\">ZX Spectrum 48</a> during my elementary school, this range stretches to more than 20 years, but that was more fun than business. In this time, I&#8217;ve developed more than <strong>50 different pieces of software</strong>, mostly <a title=\"Neolab, software development\" href=\"http://neolab.si/\" target=\"_blank\">business-oriented information systems</a>, majority of them successfully implemented. But I still <strong>don&#8217;t know shit about programming</strong>, about different environments and technologies, methodologies and other technical fetishes. And I&#8217;ve accepted the fact this situation won&#8217;t change any time soon, if ever.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Treasure_Island_Dizzy.png\" target=\"_blank\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"The first screen of the Treasure Island Dizzy,...\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/44/Treasure_Island_Dizzy.png/300px-Treasure_Island_Dizzy.png\" alt=\"The first screen of the Treasure Island Dizzy,...\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The first screen of the Treasure Island Dizzy, ZX Spectrum version (Photo credit: Wikipedia)</p></div>\n<p>When I see people like <a title=\"Swizec (swizec) on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/swizec\" target=\"_blank\">Swizec</a> doing their <a title=\"A turing machine in 133 bytes of javascript\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/a-turing-machine-in-133-bytes-of-javascript/swizec/3069\" target=\"_blank\">touring machines in hundred-something bytes in JavaScript</a>, I sadly have to admit that&#8217;s something <strong>I&#8217;m not able to reproduce</strong>. While I am <a title=\"Not bad\" href=\"http://i3.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/006/151/tumblr_lltzgnHi5F1qzib3wo1_400.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">truly impressed</a>, I know it would take me ages to understand what&#8217;s happening, so I don&#8217;t even try. Too hard core for me. In my world, the <strong>essence lies somewhere else</strong>.</p>\n<p>I see <strong>technology mostly irrelevant</strong>. It&#8217;s just the means that helps you achieve something bigger. Transformation of <a title=\"Tech hotshots: The rise of the IT business analyst\" href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9228471/Tech_hotshots_The_rise_of_the_IT_business_analyst\" target=\"_blank\">real-life processes into abstract information processes</a>, developing software that<strong>does what it&#8217;s supposed to do</strong>. That&#8217;s the goal, and it doesn&#8217;t really matter how yo get to it. In this context, I see the <strong>database as the most important part</strong> of every information system. If the data model is done properly, with <a title=\"SQL By Design: The Four Integrities\" href=\"http://www.sqlmag.com/article/performance/sql-by-design-the-four-integrities\" target=\"_blank\">integrities and proper relationships</a>, the <strong>code doesn&#8217;t stand a chance against it</strong>. It can&#8217;t fuck it up, it can&#8217;t do much more or less than what it&#8217;s supposed to do. It just makes it awesome or not.</p>\n<p>But even if I see myself as a system (database) architect, that doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t <strong>like to play</strong>. I&#8217;ve developed a few <strong>interesting prototypes</strong> in the past years, but they were all on a &#8220;higher&#8221; level. Like having an abstract <strong>super-entity</strong> that all other objects are derived from. Or having a <strong>meta-engine</strong> that serves complex applications in a similar fashion than a CMS serves a website. Or having everything in a system defined by <strong>EntityID &#8211; InstanceID</strong> (eg. User &#8211; Grega or Company &#8211; Neolab), allowing secondary requirements, such as attaching files or adding notes, trivial. Or having a<a title=\"How mini-feed and other streams revolutionized IT\" href=\"http://stritar.net/Post/How_Mini_Feed_And_Other_Streams_Revolutionized_IT.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">mini-feed similar to Facebook&#8217;s</a> to document every action in a system.</p>\n<p>But this are all abstract things, that <strong>don&#8217;t have that much to do with programming</strong>, even if they are coded. They are prototypes, serving as <strong>proof of concept</strong>, that are written poorly, and then usually <strong>rewritten by someone else</strong> who knows what he/she is doing, and from that point on, I mostly don&#8217;t understand how they are working anymore. And I really don&#8217;t mind. I try to <strong>discover the boundaries of what can be done</strong>, and since technology I work with supports that, I don&#8217;t even try to learn new ones or study the advanced details of those I use (<a href=\"http://asp.net/\" target=\"_blank\">asp.net</a> (c#) + MS SQL, if you&#8217;re interested).</p>\n<p>I think the real magic happens when <strong>profiles like Swizec and I get together</strong> (we haven&#8217;t yet, though). That&#8217;s when the synergies kick in. And it&#8217;s situations like these that make me perfectly aware that I don&#8217;t need to know much about programming to code well. And I can freely say that I will <strong>always suck at programming</strong>, and it&#8217;s ok. Black boxes happen all the time, so I have to let go to go further. Writing my crappy code that does awesome shit even though you would probably laugh at it.</p>\n<p><em><a title=\"Grega Stritar (gstritar) on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/gstritar\" target=\"_blank\">Grega Stritar</a> is an entrepreneur, software architect, blogger and geek based in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
