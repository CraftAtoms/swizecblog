Today however the problem is quite the opposite &#8211; I don&#8217;t seem to be sleepy at all and yet, I have written even less than yesterday. The inspiration just wasn&#8217;t there and yes, I know, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"NaNoWriMo\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.nanowrimo.org/\">NaNoWriMo</a> is all about making us write even when inspiration is low and just fucking get on with it mister writer! WRITE god damn it!</p>\n<p>Well I didn&#8217;t. But I have read a whole bunch of interesting questions over at <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Stack Overflow\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a> and answered some of them (if you haven&#8217;t read on twitter, I&#8217;ve decided to start paying-it-forward by answering at least one question a day). I also have created a spankingly fresh <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/swizec\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn account</a>.</p>\n<p>If nothing extraordinary like me getting an inspiration in the moment after head-hits-pillow and brain-shuts-off happens this lapse in concentration makes me roughly 4000 words behind official schedule. \\o/</p>\n<p>Who knows, tomorrow I might actually do something about that.</p>\n<p>PS: I&#8217;m delaying this being posted to catch the early crowd on twitter, yes, I&#8217;m that lame.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/a7fa5c65-e73c-4a21-baf4-3982c53927ba/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=a7fa5c65-e73c-4a21-baf4-3982c53927ba\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4c02cefa-3837-5b5e-8b29-ea800eb72259"}}
