In this event I would drum up everyone I can possibly think of that could be going through something akin to passing all exams and might want to get plastered with a bunch of idiots.</p>\n<p>The idea is to start off at Zeleni Zajec this Friday at eight-ish and have a few drinks. Then move on to a nearby pub for a few more drinks. And so on and on ad nauseum until we can&#8217;t possibly move further. I would be incredibly happy if many many people came because the more the merrier.</p>\n<p>Hey, maybe next year we can get some official t-shirts made and make the whole thing even more fun.</p>\n<p>It would also be very helpful if everyone who intends to come get drunk with us would kindly tag themselves on the <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=151604063816&amp;ref=mf\">facebook grog fest</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/5b1f3817-8f6f-4c8a-b024-05c5a097a229/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border:none;float:right\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=5b1f3817-8f6f-4c8a-b024-05c5a097a229\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8d5ef247-181e-5687-9162-9d88e91041e4"}}
