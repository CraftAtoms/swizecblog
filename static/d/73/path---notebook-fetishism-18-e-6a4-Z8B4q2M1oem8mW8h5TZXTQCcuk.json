I realize now it&#8217;s difficult to write a book when you&#8217;re coding all the time.</p>\n<p>The internet doesn&#8217;t help either.</p>\n<p>However something good did come out of this obsession with writing &#8211; at some point in high school I realized it would be incredibly useful to always keep a notebook on hand to jot down any idea that might pop up Â at an unexpected time.</p>\n<p>And so the notebook fetishism began.</p>\n<p>My first pocket notebook looked more like a collection of post-it notes inside a cardboard case thing. Of course it proved unwieldy to keep in my pocket and needless to say it eventually broke down so much it seems I&#8217;ve thrown it out &#8230; can&#8217;t find it anywhere.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s all the notebooks that survived through the years, ordered roughly in chronologically. The right-most three I&#8217;m using right now (the big one and two under it) &#8230; ok, actually the totally rightmost one is still waiting to begin its career. There&#8217;s also a fake moleskine in there; that first black notebook from the left.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Notebooks!\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tumblr_ltq8eqTVOT1qekjngo1_50016.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Notebooks! About 4 missing due to utter death</p></div>\n<p>It&#8217;s taken me <em>years</em>Â to discover the wonder that is <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Moleskine\" href=\"http://www.moleskine.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">Moleskine</a>. Now sure, some might say it&#8217;s an overpriced notebook designed to take money away from hapless hipsters.</p>\n<p>But I think Moleskine is really the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apple\" href=\"http://www.apple.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Apple</a> of notebooks, which again will say to most people that it&#8217;s an overpriced piece of kit designed to take money away from hapless hipsters. Their latest PR blunder aside, I have to say I really love these things &#8211; probably won&#8217;t be buying any other brand in the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>At least not for the ones I like to keep in my pocket. That big moleskine right there? Yeah, that was kind of stupid, sure I love it to bits, but <em>17 euro</em>Â for a notebook with ~200 pages that for some reason isn&#8217;t even hardcover? O.o</p>\n<p>Moleskine just seems to care more about details than most other notebooks I&#8217;ve tried. Where else does each notebook come with a tracking number and a note that should there be anything funky, you should just report <em>that particular</em>Â notebook and the particular quality assurance person in charge of that particular notebook will be thwapped over the nose?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure the marketing story coming with each notebook is bullshit, but it feels nice that they even care enough to include it.</p>\n<p>However, the ultimate test came when I started using the ultra skinny ones. You know, the one you can <em>actually</em>Â keep in your backpocket at all times so you literally never find yourself without a notebook as long as you aren&#8217;t naked.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 510px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Two months in a pocket\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/tumblr_ltq983kENF1qekjngo1_5006.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Two months in the backpocket</p></div>\n<p>Kept it there, nice and cosy next to my arse, for two months every day. Sat on it, sweated on it when it was hot and I was in a hurry, did unspeakably horrible things to it &#8230; nothing happened. Sure it looks battered and the covers are bent and crinkley. But not a single paper fell out, the stitching is still perfect &#8230; the cover didn&#8217;t even start layering!</p>\n<p>Any other notebook I&#8217;ve had felt like it was about to die after a week of staying in my pocket &#8230; papers starting to fall out, the back breaking &#8230; things like that.</p>\n<p>Anyone else a fan of notebooks that just work?</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.fabsugar.com/Notably-Cute-Notebooks-39487\">Notably Cute Notebooks</a> (fabsugar.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://nopenintended.wordpress.com/2011/10/15/mini-review-rhodia-5x5-grid-pad-no-10/\">Mini Review: Rhodia 5Ã—5 Grid Pad No. 10</a> (nopenintended.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://practicalpages.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/a-little-house-notebook/\">A Little House Notebook</a> (practicalpages.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.newcommbiz.com/moleskine-alternatives-for-gtd-hacking/\">Moleskine Alternatives For GTD Hacking</a> (newcommbiz.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//www.guardian.co.uk/books/booksblog/2011/jul/07/notebooks-euchtterm1917-moleskine&amp;a=48111636&amp;rid=dc5e50b1-edaa-44e7-973a-9d2ca31bb15a&amp;e=baf2d7bbfdb45fbc4d8b138bbfe622d2\">Notes on notebooks</a> (guardian.co.uk)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=dc5e50b1-edaa-44e7-973a-9d2ca31bb15a\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e96308ca-af7b-57c7-8e19-7710d8955c22"}}
