The feature that made me try VSCode for real. You can hover any function or variable, press command, and see its definition in a little popup. Or jump straight to the code.</p>\n<p>üòç</p>\n<p>I think I have the perfect config going, and I&#8217;d share it with you, but I don&#8217;t know how. Mainly I focused on getting a clean interface where code dominates.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7919\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screenshot-1.png\" width=\"738\" height=\"1024\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screenshot-1.png 738w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screenshot-1-216x300.png 216w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" />\n<p>Blank slate with a bunch of code.

I&#8217;d like to indent to automatic correct indentation instead of having to press it multiple times. When cursor is in indent space, tab should jump to beginning of line, when cursor is in code space, tab should indent or do nothing.</li>\n<li>I installed emacs keybindings to preserve muscle memory, and now jump-to-line shortcut doesn&#8217;t work</li>\n<li>the <code>cmd+P</code> magic search can be annoyingly dumb sometimes, and the UI struggles with long file paths. Shows beginning of path instead of the important stuff</li>\n<li>the <code>cmd+O</code> shortcut isn&#8217;t context aware. Opens UI at last visited folder instead of at current file</li>\n<li>no good shortcut for &#8220;jump back to previous file&#8221; that I can find</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Any ideas? <a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=.@swizec%20you%20should%20try%20this%20for%20@code%20%F0%9F%91%89\">@ me</a></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5a4a4b63-ee00-54f9-b23d-d10404d2b6bf"}}
