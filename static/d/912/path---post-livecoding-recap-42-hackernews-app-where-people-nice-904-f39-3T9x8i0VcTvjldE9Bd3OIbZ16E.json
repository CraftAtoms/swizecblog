Usually shorter than 500 words. Often with pictures. Livecoding happens almost <strong>every Sunday at 2pm PDT</strong> on multiple channels. You should follow <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/TheSwizec\">My Youtube</a> channel to catch me live.</em></p>\n<p>This weekend, I tried something new: Coding from a pleasant sunny location. It didn&#8217;t go so well.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7700\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/swiz-face.png\" width=\"1008\" height=\"584\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/swiz-face.png 1008w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/swiz-face-300x174.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/swiz-face-768x445.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" />\n<p>First, the internet was atrocious. My stream kept lagging and cutting off and being blurry. In the end, I had to crank the bitrate and resolution way down. That helped, sort of.</p>\n<p>Second, YouTube blocked my video based on copyright. Listening to music through your monitor and recording it as a background murmur through your mic is okay. Listening through laptop and using the built-in mic is not okay.</p>\n<p><em>shrug</em></p>\n<p>Third, I got sunburnt on half of my face. <strong>BUT</strong> new MacBook Pro screens work in sunlight! You can actually see the screen now üòÅ</p>\n<p>Fourth, my girlfriend decided it would be funny to water me like a plant. It was not. üòí</p>\n<p>The good news is YouTube offers a &#8220;remove song&#8221; feature, so I might be able to salvage this video. We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7699\" src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/YT-screenshot.png\" width=\"1236\" height=\"86\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/YT-screenshot.png 1236w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/YT-screenshot-300x21.png 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/YT-screenshot-768x53.png 768w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/YT-screenshot-1024x71.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1236px) 100vw, 1236px\" />\n<p><iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nHsPzNz8MW4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2GDx8PAwkc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>Yes, two livecoding sessions last week. üôÇ</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t finish the app while streaming. There&#8217;s going to be a full tutorial and proper edited video on <a href=\"http://school.shoutem.com/\">React Native School</a> later this week.</p>\n<p>So what was I even building?</p>\n<p>One of those HackerNews App projects. You know the type; it&#8217;s not quite a TODO app, but it&#8217;s similarly generic and a common example to show people how things are done.</p>\n<p>Mine&#8217;s going to have a twist though: It‚Äôs gonna hide comments and stories where <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/\">semantic analysis</a> says people aren&#8217;t being nice.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tutorial idea: building a Hacker News clone where people are nice</p>\n<p>&mdash; Dan Abramov (@dan_abramov) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/882757021124235264\">July 6, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s going to work.</p>\n<p>I ran some positive and negative comments through Google Cloud&#8217;s Natural Language API, and it looks promising. Bad comments get a negative score, good comments are positive, most are neutral.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as good as their <a href=\"https://www.perspectiveapi.com/#/\">Perspective API</a> promises to be. Unlike Perspective, it&#8217;s already here and should work as a proof of concept.</p>\n<p>Plan is to have the app finished tonight and a full tutorial out by Wednesday.</p>\n<p>The trickiest part is convincing React Native to render HackerNews comments because they&#8217;re in HTML. Guess what doesn&#8217;t automatically render in a native app? That&#8217;s right‚Ä¶ HTML.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s Webviews, but I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about those. Feels hamfisted for text that only does italics, quotes, and links.</p>\n<p>Some htmltext components do exist, but they&#8217;re old. Might have to roll my own.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll see.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4704a30e-b88d-5315-a4c2-6d2017dc59d0"}}
