You do things out in the open, you help when you can, and you ask for help when you can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/swyx\">@swyx</a> did an amazing thing and hunted down the source of my woes. It&#8217;s a <a href=\"https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/6032\">GraphQL query compiler bug</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanditjia\">@ryanditjia</a> was nice enough to submit a PR with a workaround. Thanks, Ryan and Shawn ðŸ¤˜</p>\n<h2>The new StaticQuery system</h2>\n<p>Gatsby v2 has a new <code>StaticQuery</code> system, and it&#8217;s got a bug.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure what <code>StaticQuery</code> is supposed to do, or how, but <a href=\"https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/migrating-from-v1-to-v2/#update-layout-component\">the migration guide</a> says you should use it to get info about your site. Title, description, stuff like that.</p>\n<p>I suspect you&#8217;re meant to change all those <code>export const query = graphql</code> queries into a <code>StaticQuery</code>. Will have to experiment some more, read a doc or two ðŸ˜‡</p>\n<p>The easiest way to refactor your components to use StaticQuery goes like this ðŸ‘‡</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\n// src/components/layout.js\n\nexport default ({ children }) => (\n  <StaticQuery\n    query={graphql`\n      query LayoutQuery {\n        site {\n          siteMetadata {\n            title\n            description\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    `}\n    render={data => <Layout data={data}>{children}</Layout>}\n  />\n)\n</pre>\n<p>I used it for my <code>Layout</code> component.</p>\n<p>StaticQuery takes a <code>query</code> prop, which needs your graphql query. The stuff you used to <code>export const query =</code>. And a <code>render</code> prop, which takes the component you want to render once you have data.</p>\n<p>When Gatsby fixes the bug, you&#8217;ll be able to make that code more readable like this:</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\nexport default ({ children }) => (\n  <StaticQuery\n    query={query}\n    render={data => <Layout data={data}>{children}</Layout>}\n  />\n)\n</pre>\n<p>Beta software, amirite?</p>\n<h2>A tedious gotcha with packages</h2>\n<p>Another gotcha with the upgrade is the manual process to upgrade all your packages.</p>\n<p>You have to go into <code>package.json</code>, find everything that starts with <code>gatsby-</code>, and change its version to <code>next</code>. Then you have to hunt through the new <a href=\"https://next.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/\">Gatsby Plugins Library</a> and see if anything you&#8217;re using has new peer dependencies.</p>\n<p>You have to install peer dependencies yourself. I always forget that one.</p>\n<p>For example, Gatsby used to come with React packaged in. Now you have to install it yourself because it&#8217;s a peer dependency.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s no telling which of the plugins you&#8217;re using decided to pull similar tricks moving to Gatsby v2. Alas.</p>\n<p>I wish there was a code mod for that, but most people aren&#8217;t running enough Gatsby sites to make the time savings worth it.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion ðŸ¤¨</h2>\n<p>Beta software, amirite?</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re running Gatsby v1, you should upgrade. Everything seems stable enough. <a href=\"https://learnwhileyoupoop.com\">My site, Learn While You Poop</a>, is up and running. Ludicrously faster than it was before.</p>\n<p>Now I just gotta make the improvements I was planning to make before I got distracted by the upgrade ðŸ˜…</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d2182fba-901b-5363-9f8f-298e0e28b815"}}
