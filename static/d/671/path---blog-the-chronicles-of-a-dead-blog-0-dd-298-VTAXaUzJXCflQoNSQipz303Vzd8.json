{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"The chronicles of a dead blog","content":"<p>\n This blog has been dead for a month it would seem. Not my fault, well it is, but let&#39;s pretend it&#39;s not, I was just too arrogant to put quite anything on here and I guess I didn&#39;t have any ideas deemed worthwhile to blog about. Fuck it, it happens.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before I vanished into the ether of real life this website had about 300 hits over the period of &quot;last 30 days&quot; on google analytics when I blogged nearly every day, now it has about 200 &#8230; which is kind of surprising seeming as how there was nothing here for a while. You&#39;d think people would go away, but apparently they kept hoping. So everyone still hoping and reading this now, you can tell all the rest of your hundred buddies that I&#39;ll now make a real effort to blog more. A real one, not a fake one. A really real one, honest.\n</p>\n<p>\n See the thing that&#39;s hampering me down the most is that many people know about this blog and some of them don&#39;t have the security clearance to know some things and so there&#39;s less topics to talk about. I also find it a bit dull to just talk about my day to day life, that&#39;s not blogging, that&#39;s being boring.\n</p>\n<p>\n So uhm &#8230; yes that&#39;s it for now. I&#39;m at work actually, listening to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/watch?v=eELH0ivexKA\" target=\"_blank\">Cup of Brown Joy</a> over a cup of brown joy. Cheery oh.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7c7edba9-b120-550d-b14c-da203566f5b1"}}
