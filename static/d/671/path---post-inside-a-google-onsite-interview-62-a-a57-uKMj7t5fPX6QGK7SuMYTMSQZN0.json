Here it is.\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/google-sent-me-a-what-to-know-in-on-site-interviews-email-here-it-is/swizec/4251\">Google sent me a &#8220;What to know in onsite interviews&#8221; email</a>.</p>\n<p>And here I was, completely unprepared, having the time of my life just chiling in the awesome parlour they have going at the reception desk (inside a very confusing building &#8230; who puts a reception desk on the top floor anyway?)</p>\n<p><em>A disclaimer: some say they had to sign NDA&#8217;s and stuff. Nobody mentioned to me personally that any of this was a secret. And hey, <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/How-many-people-who-take-the-Google-onsite-interviews-end-up-getting-the-job\" target=\"_blank\">only ~25% of onsite candidates get hired</a>, there are 30,000 employees &#8211; that means 120,000 people have seen what happens.</em></p>\n<p><em>It&#8217;s not a secret.</em></p>\n<h2>The interviews</h2>\n<p>There I was, lounging in a comfy leather chair. Just when I was thinking <em>&#8220;Fuck, I blew it. I knew I shouldn&#8217;t have been 5 minutes late!&#8221;</em> my recruiter came in through the door and apologized &#8211; her office is across the street nowadays and it takes a while to get to the main building.</p>\n<p>Phew.</p>\n<p>She walked me through a series of doors, swiped her keycard a few times, quipped about the <em>epic</em> naming scheme for the interview (meeting?) rooms. Named after cornerstone computers of history, most recently The Watson.</p>\n<p>I found myself in a small white room. Nothing more than a desk, a small whiteboard, a phone and a huge LCD screen. Hell, the holding room at the police station I was once taken to as a teen was bigger.</p>\n<img class=\" alignnone\" title=\"A small interview room at Google\" src=\"http://distilleryimage11.instagram.com/f70b24e69e7f11e1af7612313813f8e8_7.jpg\" alt=\"A small interview room at Google\" width=\"490\" height=\"490\" />\n<p>Apparently I drew the short stick and got the smallest whiteboard available as well. Maybe they knew I was short and just wanted to make me comfortable?</p>\n<p>A few moments later, my first interviewer came in. Said hello, and went right to business.</p>\n<h2>The Questions</h2>\n<p>There were only three things anyone cared for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>ability to solve problems you&#8217;ve never heard of</li>\n<li>Big-O and efficiency</li>\n<li><em>no</em> whiteboard coding, that means catching all <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Off-by-one error\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-by-one_error\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">off-by-one errors</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I especially loved the insistence on solving all problems cold. At one point I said <em>Oh cool, I&#8217;ve heard of this problem before</em> and the engineer <strong>immediately</strong> swapped it out for a new one.</p>\n<p>As a result the whole experience was much more fun &#8211; it felt like solving a series of interesting little coding puzzles that are easy enough to be solvable in full and at most optimal within ~30 minutes, but are juuuuust hard enough you actually have to rack your brain a little bit to get them.</p>\n<p>Lexical knowledge? Forget about it, whenever you don&#8217;t <em>know</em> something, they just wave you on and say it&#8217;s not really important. And you can tell it doesn&#8217;t matter. They don&#8217;t even write it down in their notes that hey, there&#8217;s this little thing you couldn&#8217;t remember off the top of your head.</p>\n<p>My questions were a mix bag of designing systems and algorithms</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there used to be a list of questions here, but I took them out after being informed that they don&#8217;t actually have hundreds of questions available to ask people</li>\n<li>they were essentially questions similar to those you might experience in a high school (or possibly college) programming competition</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those were the interesting questions anyway, sprinkled between these were explanations of <em>A Recent Interesting Thing You Did &#8482;</em> &#8211; makes me giddy I gave three different answers to this question. Just to avoid talking about the same stuff all the time 🙂</p>\n<p>Oh and I guess there were <em>some</em> lexical questions, like what is a singleton and how you&#8217;d get rid of it, how do closures function  and how does a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Domain Name System\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">DNS lookup</a> work.</p>\n<h2>How I did?</h2>\n<p>Honestly, I have no idea how I did.</p>\n<p>Sure, I solved all the problems. With the exception of one, I even came up with the most optimal solution on my own. And I managed to catch all the off-by-one errors and corner cases and everything.</p>\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t <em>really</em> matter how well <strong>I</strong> did, what matters is how many others did better than me in all those little nuances like how quickly it took to solve a problem, how much you communicate and so on &#8230; so it&#8217;s really hard to say.</p>\n<p>What I <strong><em>can</em></strong> say, however, is that it was one of the most fun days I&#8217;ve ever had and I deeply regret the fact there were only five interviews. Everything was over with much too quickly &#8230;</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, I didn&#8217;t even get the answer to my main question: <em>&#8220;What&#8217;s working at Google like, really?&#8221;</em> (seems like they aren&#8217;t allowed to talk about this, you get canned responses when asking)</p>\n<p>So I still don&#8217;t know if Google is a place I would want to work at, but my god the lunch was amazing. If they extend an offer I might accept for the food alone!</p>\n<p>PS: A coffee lab is where Googlers drink their caffeine inside the building</p>\n<img class=\"alignnone\" title=\"A Google coffee lab\" src=\"http://distilleryimage2.instagram.com/23b9b7a09e8011e1a9f71231382044a1_7.jpg\" alt=\"A Google coffee lab\" width=\"612\" height=\"612\" />\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-interview-with-googles-maile-ohye\" target=\"_blank\">Whiteboard Friday &#8211; Interview with Google&#8217;s Maile Ohye</a> (seomoz.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57434191-94/no-terminator-style-overlays-in-first-batch-of-google-glasses/?part=rss&amp;subj=News-Mobile\" target=\"_blank\">No Terminator-style overlays in first batch of Google Glasses</a> (news.cnet.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.seomoz.org/blog/replicate-googles-panda-questionnaire-whiteboard-friday\" target=\"_blank\">Replicate Google&#8217;s Panda Questionnaire &#8211; Whiteboard Friday</a> (seomoz.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=02b2f493-1a1f-44ab-befd-b24077cff27e\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d972b9fb-23d5-547c-8c60-6ebf2ae778cb"}}
