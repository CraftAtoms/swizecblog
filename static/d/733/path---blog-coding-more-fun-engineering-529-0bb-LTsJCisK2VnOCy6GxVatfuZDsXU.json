{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Why coding is more fun than engineering","content":"<p>Because coding is play and engineering is work.</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s less obvious is that play gets more work done than work. Free from obligation, you can explore more options, discover new possibilities, and stay in flow for longer.</p>\n<p>Let me show you.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a typical week of engineering according to my time tracker. I try to click the button every time I context switch for more than 5 minutes. Call it research into office culture, if you will.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ilGWYb4.png\" alt=\"Each column is a day\" /><figcaption>Each column is a day</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This data is by no means perfect. Context switches happen within categories; I forget to click the button; and I&#8217;ve given up capturing the small distractions that happen.</p>\n<p>I also spend too much time in faux meetings on Slack. Those don’t show up here.</p>\n<p>But you can see a trend: most work happens in half-hour and aaaalmost-an-hour intervals. Then something comes up, and I have to switch. QA bugging out, absolutely horribly urgent code reviews that must happen right this instance, a deployment here and there, or a short meeting or two.</p>\n<p>If I&#8217;m very lucky, I get to work on something for almost 2 hours. Sometimes, if the stars align just so, almost 3. That happened <em>three</em> times this week. Three times all week that I focused for more than an hour. ?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now compare that mess to a night of coding.</p>\n<p>I started at 12:30am after a short nap. Before me, a <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/livecoding-24-choropleth-react-js/swizec/7078\">choropleth map of household incomes</a>.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/REu8pM0.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>By 1:38am, it was a choropleth map of income disparity between the tech industry individuals and the median household. And a histogram.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"pt\" dir=\"ltr\">Declarative dataviz. <a href=\"https://t.co/v94lcaV5Df\">pic.twitter.com/v94lcaV5Df</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/786123886261743616\">October 12, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>At 2:35am, the map could focus on specific US states, and the histogram had a line that showed median household income in that state against a backdrop of tech salary distribution in said state.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most software developers in CA make more than the median household.</p>\n<p>Dataviz almost done ? <a href=\"https://t.co/tI6Dzhbuqt\">pic.twitter.com/tI6Dzhbuqt</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/786138188502884353\">October 12, 2016</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>By 3:46AM, the visualization had filtering controls, a dynamically updating title and description, and was ready to go.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-lang=\"en\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Many people have been asking me for this for almost 2 years.

In the context of engineering, something like this would take a week, involve 2 engineers, 1 project manager, 1 designer, 3 meetings, and 2 QA people. The end result would be 10% better.</p>\n<p>Sigh.</p>\n<p>PS: the viz flopped because I tried to give it a spin that doesn&#8217;t gel with the audience that received it, and I have to improve initial load time somehow. Lessons learned.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"64fa0af3-dc45-5e40-aa13-7f36404e1d00"}}
