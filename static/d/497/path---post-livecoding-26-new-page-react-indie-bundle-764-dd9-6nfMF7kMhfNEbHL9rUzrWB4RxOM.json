{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Livecoding #26: A new page for a new React Indie Bundle","content":"<p><em>This is a Livecoding Recap ‚Äì an almost-weekly post about interesting things discovered while livecoding ?. Always under 500 words and with pictures. You can follow my channel <a href=\"https://livecoding.tv/swizec\">here</a>. New content almost <strong>every Sunday at 2pm Pacific</strong>. There‚Äôs live chat, come say hai ?</em></p>\n<p>In an unprecedented move, this weekend I livecoded twice. There was much to do.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/swizec/videos/LD5zG/embed\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.livecoding.tv/swizec/videos/rwggV/embed\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>\n<p>No livecoding for the third session. Girlfriends and birds need sleep, and my office has no door. Silly, I know. What kind of office doesn&#39;t have a door? ¬Ø&#95;(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø<br />\n</em></p>\n<p>The first session revolved around two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wait, what&#39;s in the Bundle again?</li>\n<li>I can&#39;t design, but maybe I can find a good thing on Themeforest.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second session was all about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aaaaaah My old React framework for landing pages doesn&#39;t work with this theme I bought and this theme is being confusing and I don&#39;t know how turn bits of it into React components aaaaaah!</li>\n</ul>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FpcN8fN.gif\" />\n<p>I&#39;m not going to spell out the first section here just yet. The bundle is going to be amazing, and if you want to see what it&#39;s <em>probably</em> going to contain, watch the video. Hopefully I get final confirmation from the other authors soon ?</p>\n<p>There are going to be 3 tiers again, just like last year: Basic, Epic, Majestic. I wanted to do two tiers, but Stephen is a machine, and we have too much amazing stuff to offer. Pricing just didn&#39;t make sense with two tiers. Alas.</p>\n<p>Basic might be a bit pricey right now. Is $89 too much for the basic offering if full value is $149? ?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This year&#39;s page is built around the <em>&quot;Why we ‚ù§Ô∏è React&quot;</em> theme. Last year, it was all about &quot;Take the leap, learn React, it&#39;s cool, we promise&quot; and about making more money and building shit faster. That worked great in 2015, but I think that in 2016, everyone already knows a lot of this.</p>\n<p>So I wanted to make it more community focused. Promote the React love, let others talk about why it&#39;s great, then offer a helping hand in learning. Thoughts?</p>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7ztmthi.png\" />\n<p>I&#39;m hoping to convince the other authors &#8211; Stephen, Andrzej, Juho, Azat &#8211; to make a 10- or 20-second selfie video saying why they love React. That would work marvelously on the page, I think.</p>\n<p>Last time someone asked me for a video testimonial, it took 5 weeks to muster the courage. We&#39;ll see how that works. Cyber Monday is around the corner üòÄ</p>\n<p>Hmmm &#8230; technical stuff ?</p>\n<p>Honestly, there isn&#39;t that much technical stuff that goes into slapping together a landing page. It follows this pattern:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Look at bought theme</li>\n<li>Oooh, I like this widget!</li>\n<li>Inspect source</li>\n<li>Copy-pasta source as React component</li>\n<li>Repeat until done</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Labour intensive at first, but gets quicker and quicker. For example, I can now make dark sections with top or bottom decoration like this:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;DarkSection hasTop=\"rightSlope\"\n             hasBottom=\"zigZag\"&gt;\n    &lt;Content.WhyPain /&gt;\n&lt;/DarkSection&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Neat.</p>\n<p>You can see the <a href=\"https://github.com/Swizec/new-react-bundle-page\">source on github</a>.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the audience for helping with the pricing and picking a theme. You guys rock üôÇ</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"77486dde-e4ed-54e6-9cb9-d3d5265005f0"}}
