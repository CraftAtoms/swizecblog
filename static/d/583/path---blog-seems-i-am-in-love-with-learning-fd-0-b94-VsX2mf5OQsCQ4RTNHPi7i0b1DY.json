Hard. And I have the scrapes and possible bruises to prove it!</p>\n<p>Apparently going uphill on a longboard is a lot harder than it looks when you&#8217;ve been riding one a cumulative of &#8230; three or four hours. Somehow my trajectory changed from being perpendicular to the hill or the hill changed slopes &#8230; all I know is that at some point my legs were crossed and I was in the air.</p>\n<p>The result was a very happy swizec with a smile up to his ears. I realized something in that moment &#8211;&gt; the reason I fell in love with riding a longboard (I&#8217;d say <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Longboarding\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longboarding\" rel=\"wikipedia\">longboarding</a>, but that implies going down a hill and I&#8217;m too pussy to do that) so quickly is that I don&#8217;t know how to do it!</p>\n<p>Three days ago I was such a noob at this stuff it took me longer to get home from college than it would on foot.Â Now it&#8217;s as quick as rollerblading (on my old skates) and getting faster. A lot faster!</p>\n<p>Thing is, I sort of jumped into the deep end with this. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/zidarsk8\">@zidarsk8</a> just showed me how to stop, I still can&#8217;t brake, I can only stop. Sort of. The rest I had to figure out on my own and it&#8217;s this steep learning curve that is the most thrilling thing to me.</p>\n<p>This is [probably] why I change technologies so quickly. This must be why I started the whole being entrepreneurial thing. If it isn&#8217;t hard, it&#8217;s boring, and if it&#8217;s boring I don&#8217;t want to do it.</p>\n<p>Jumping into the deep end is <em>fun!</em></p>\n<p>I wonder if there&#8217;s a correlation between people who don&#8217;t enjoy living safely and startup founders &#8230; any idea how to find that out?</p>\n<p>Also, I&#8217;m left wondering why this love for learning isn&#8217;t translating into a good academic track record O.o</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://srttourteam.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/longboards/\">Longboards</a> (srttourteam.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://someguynamedben.wordpress.com/2011/07/02/yay-longboard/\">Yay!
