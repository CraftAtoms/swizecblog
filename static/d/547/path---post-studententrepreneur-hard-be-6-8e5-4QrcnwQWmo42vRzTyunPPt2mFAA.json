The point was to perform the function of a live demo for my startup incubator and help them get more startups that way.</p>\n<p>My personal point was to get some blokes to go <em>&#8220;HEY! I wanna to help with that too!&#8221;, </em>which of course did not happen because the audience was mostly electronics and hardware people. But nevertheless, it was a lovely chat.</p>\n<p>Although, I noticed a very interesting trend. None of them felt very keen on becoming entrepreneurs while still at uni. They thought it was too hard, that next to classes and studying they don&#8217;t really have time to do anything else. Hell, I even got an almostpplause for being such an impressive lad that I can do both AND keep a girlfriend.</p>\n<p>But seriously, it&#8217;s not hard at all. Just take this week&#8217;s Tuesday as an example:</p>\n<blockquote><p>On Tuesday I worked for nine hours, five of which were studying/taking a hard maths exam (I count school as work because it&#8217;s my &#8220;job&#8221;). I went to the playhouse and I watched an episode of <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/guid/9202a8c04000641f80000000004a9577\" title=\"House (TV series)\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_%28TV_series%29\">House</a>. I also helped my girlfriend prepare a presentation for school.</p>\n<p>And I still went to bed by midnight.</p></blockquote>\n<p>See, it&#8217;s <em>that</em> fucking hard!</p>\n<p>Not only have I never passed as many exams as I have now that I&#8217;m also an <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/entrepreneur\" title=\"Entrepreneur\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneur\">entrepreneur</a>, I&#8217;ve also taken up a new sport (boxing), which takes six hours out of every week.</p>\n<p>Sure it&#8217;s not all fun and games and many people find it difficult to jam 60 to 70 working hours into every week. But if you think being a student and an entrepreneur is hard, you&#8217;re trippin&#8217; man. Seriously.</p>\n<p>Just get off yer arse and <em>do</em> it. The television and alcohol can take care of themselves.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/bd314f7b-c5ee-4679-9dac-34dffbed9ae6/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=bd314f7b-c5ee-4679-9dac-34dffbed9ae6\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b5246940-9f88-56e2-9743-7a93a6e8aab7"}}
