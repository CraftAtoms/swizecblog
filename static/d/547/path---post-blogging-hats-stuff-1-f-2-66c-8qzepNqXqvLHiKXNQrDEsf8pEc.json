The talk was about this blog and how after <a title=\"Why programmers work at night\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/why-programmers-work-at-night/swizec/3198\">that one insanely popular post</a>everyone suddenly decided I know what I&#8217;m doing and should tell others how its done.</p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 1.4em;\">Video at bottom</em></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s funny how difficult coming up with a talk is when somebody tweets you <em>Hey, you should totally come give a talk about blogging.</em> The problem with these kinds of talk is that you don&#8217;t really know what you&#8217;ll be trying to say. Every time you&#8217;re up there on stage you should have a message &#8211; something to convince the audience of.</p>\n<p>Just giving a general talk <em>sucks</em> for that. It invariably turns into something a bit like this post &#8211; a rambling conglomerate of sentences that sort of go together. Always reminds me of that one line in a movie: <em>You talk a lot, but you don&#8217;t say much.</em></p>\n<p>I guess the overall message of my talk was this:</p>\n<p><em style=\"font-size: 1.3em;\">Patience! It takes a lot of patience and sticking-to-it-ness, don&#8217;t do if it isn&#8217;t inherently fun for you.</em></p>\n<p>Despite all of that I think the talk was a smashing success. Sure I forgot to even mention hats &#8211; was supposed to mention changing the blog&#8217;s name from Cthulhu and Other Crazies to A Geek With a Hat &#8230; oops? In general the talk ended up a bit rambley, even finished with &#8220;Wait, there was something else I wanted to say &#8230; oh well. Questions?&#8221;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not a very strong ending. The originally planned ending was: <em>But hey, at least I&#8217;m no longer The Author on hackernews, but Swizec</em></p>\n<p>All in all, rhetoric sucked, body language was attrocious, hands found their way into pockets several times, but people laughed a few times, asked a bunch of questions and I think everyone had fun. This one girl even asked for actual advice and I thank her for thinking I know enough to give advice about this stuff.</p>\n<p>The slides for <a href=\"http://speakerdeck.com/u/swizec/p/blogging-hats-stuff\" target=\"_blank\">Blogging, hats, stuff</a> are over at Speakerdeck whose embeds don&#8217;t work with WordPress &#8230; there is also a video.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"http://kiberpipa.openlectures.net/SU_Swizec_Teller-Bloganje_klobuki/video/1/iframe/\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"270px\"></iframe></p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://brian.kingsonline.net/talk/2011/10/web-hour-zemanta-mozilla-success/\">Web Hour + Zemanta + Mozilla = Success</a> (brian.kingsonline.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//money.cnn.com/2012/01/13/technology/sal_khan_best_advice.fortune/index.htm&amp;a=71417522&amp;rid=d059e249-7cef-4f9a-9287-844dce83e91a&amp;e=23df49d4c5da66b3b023eda0ebdb9d56\">Sal Khan: The best advice I ever got</a> (money.cnn.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://markos.gaivo.net/blog/?p=807\">6th anniversary of wwwh</a> (markos.gaivo.net)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://doingthewritething.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/odd-like-us/\">Odd Like Us</a> (doingthewritething.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.tablix.org/~avian/blog/archives/2012/01/video_of_my_433_mhz_receiver_talk/\">Video of my 433 MHz receiver talk</a> (tablix.org)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=d059e249-7cef-4f9a-9287-844dce83e91a\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"89478093-3ad8-5293-851d-a59612480ffc"}}
