You get to discover a lot of very interesting things, like this epic breakfast place in Mission called Boogaloos. It is in fact so awesome that there was a whole bunch of people waiting their turn to go into the diner on the freezing cold (12C, drizzle, wind).</p>\n<p>I spent more than two hours cycling around in a sort of drunk man pattern, as you can see on the <a href=\"http://runkeeper.com/user/swizec/activity/46686102\">runkeeper map</a>.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I learnt is that no matter how fine you feel, an hour of sleep isn&#8217;t very conductive to general productivity of the following day.
