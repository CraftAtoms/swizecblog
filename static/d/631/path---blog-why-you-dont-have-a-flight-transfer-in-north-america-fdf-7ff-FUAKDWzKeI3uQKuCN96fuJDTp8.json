Cool!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>&#8230;</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Yeah, looks like the bus is running a bit late. How come you&#8217;re taking a bus from the airport anyway?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>He was from Poland, visiting <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Canada\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=45.4,-75.6666666667&amp;spn=10.0,10.0&amp;q=45.4,-75.6666666667 (Canada)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">Canada</a> for a telecoms training programme. We didn&#8217;t really go into the details. For the next few hours our conversations revolved around wondering where the bus might be, whether we&#8217;re waiting for the previous bus or already for the next one. And how cold Canada is.</p>\n<p>We quickly established we both flew in from Munich on the same flight. <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lufthansa\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.9375,6.96972222222&amp;spn=0.01,0.01&amp;q=50.9375,6.96972222222 (Lufthansa)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">Lufthansa</a> 474, a lovely modern airplane with cheap transatlantic wi-fi, surprisingly comfortable seats and USB ports in the arm rests so you don&#8217;t have to worry about your phone running out of charge.</p>\n<p>It really was a very lovely flight and the seven and a half hours passed before you can say <em>&#8220;Maybe I should watch a movie or something&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Or maybe <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Shin Dong-hyuk (human rights activist)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Dong-hyuk_%28human_rights_activist%29\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\">Escape from Camp 14</a> was just that interesting a book (it was)</p>\n<p>And now, we were both waiting for a bus that wasn&#8217;t showing up. Standing out in the cold Canadian winds of early Spring. At least it wasn&#8217;t snowing like I&#8217;m told it did last week.</p>\n<p>At the border we both made the same fatal mistake &#8211; telling the truth. You <em>always</em> say you&#8217;re a tourist. They let you through quickly if you are. Instead the border guards told us simply <em>&#8220;Please step that way to immigration&#8221;.</em></p>\n<p>Very scary words when you&#8217;re connecting flight is in an hour, you have to re-do check-in, security and everything else just like it was a completely new flight. Madening.</p>\n<p>The line wasn&#8217;t moving anywhere and my restlessness grew. I think I remember the Polish guy being up slightly before me. I think the guards loudly said <em>&#8220;Ok so you&#8217;re 19 and you&#8217;re here to do training? Really?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Imagine being 19 years old, about to miss your next flight, talking to a very indifferent immigration officer.</p>\n<p>When I came up everything went smoothly, but I didn&#8217;t have any information printed. Why would I print my itinerary? That&#8217;s just silly. The iPad mail search was very slow, the wi-fi wasn&#8217;t running nearly quickly enough and as I frantically switched between Mail.app and Safari to see which would be faster in finding my email the immigration guard was growing impatient.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;What, you can&#8217;t find it?&#8221;, </em>she said. Her voice starting to smell of calling me a liar and thinking I want to stay here forever and ever without a proper permit.</p>\n<p>When I was finally let through I ended up standing in the wrong line for too long. If I had run like a madman, done everything correctly, I might, just might, catch my next flight. When I finally realized my error and located the proper counter for check-in to my next flight the nice lady just scoffed.</p>\n<p><em>&#8220;Haha, no you can&#8217;t check-in to that flight anymore.&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>As if I was telling her the funniest joke ever. I knew it was laughable, but worth a try right?</p>\n<p>She actually ended up being quite nice. Told me that the two flights still available for last night are fully booked and I should go talk to Lufthansa. She was <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Air Canada\" href=\"http://www.aircanada.com/en/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Air Canada</a> because Lufthansa told me just moments ago they don&#8217;t really have flights from Montreal to Ottawa and I should ask Air Canada.</p>\n<p>The Lufthansa lady told me that I&#8217;m shit out of luck. Because it&#8217;s not their fault I missed my plane they can rebook me, but can&#8217;t pay for a hotel or reimburse me in any way. Immigration&#8217;s fault is not their mess to clean up and everyone else made the flight.</p>\n<p>Not everyone. Remember the Polish kid?</p>\n<p>Air Canada told me they can put me on standby for the 10:30 flight, but out of 37 passengers 32 had already checked in and one was on standby. Not much of a chance of making it, I should try the bus lest I become stuck at the airport overnight.</p>\n<p>Bouncing from two information desks I finally made it to the bus stop. Waiting for the 8:25 bus.</p>\n<p>A bus came, but it was for <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Quebec\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=46.8161111111,-71.2241666667&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=46.8161111111,-71.2241666667 (Quebec)&amp;t=h\" rel=\"geolocation\" target=\"_blank\">Quebec</a>. This was when I met the Polish kid. For the next few hours we were inseparable. It&#8217;s strange how quickly people can make temporary friends. There&#8217;s a feeling of safety in a pair. Much better than being alone even if both of you are confused, lost, and have no idea how or when they&#8217;re making it to their destination.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s comforting just to have someone standing next to you who is in the same mess.</p>\n<p>By 9pm the bus was nowhere to be found. Information desk assured us it was on the way. In either case, there was another bus at 10:55. It should be at the stop by 10:40.</p>\n<p>At 10:55 there was still no bus.</p>\n<p>There were many other buses. Quebec. Nothing for Ottawa.</p>\n<p>Just as we were both coming to terms with the idea of having to take a cab all the way to Ottawa or waiting for a new plane next morning a bus showed up. 10:59.</p>\n<p>It was a rundown <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Greyhound Lines\" href=\"http://www.greyhound.com/\" rel=\"homepage\" target=\"_blank\">Greyhound bus</a>, but it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. The bus driver was a grumpy person doing a night shift on Easter. He didn&#8217;t seem very happy about having to deal with us. But at least he would take us to Ottawa.</p>\n<p>Two hours later, Greyhound terminal in Ottawa.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the night it looked liek I was in the middle of nowhere. There were no people to be seen. A bunch of buses waiting around. I think I saw a group of travelers sleeping around their suitcases inside, but to be honest everything was a haze by now.</p>\n<p>Google Maps said it was just a few minutes walk to my hotel. I couldn&#8217;t be bothered, I just wanted to be done with this. Collapsed into the first cab that pulled up and told the driver to take me to Les Suites.</p>\n<p>Despite this ordeal and everyone&#8217;s indifference and frenchness at the airport Canada turned out to be very nice. This morning I got free drinks at Starbucks because none of my cards would work.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=6f7fac20-5511-4781-8a3e-5943af90dcc1\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"31918de9-4960-5656-8cda-ee07eb4e45bc"}}
