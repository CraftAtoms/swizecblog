They shrug and work around it. They might even complain a little. Let out a curse word or two. But otherwise pretty much get on with their life.</p>\n<p>An entrepreneur, on the other hand, will go &#8220;Hmm, I think I can fix that&#8221;.</p>\n<p>What happens when almost every thing you touch is suboptimal? When whatever you happen to be doing, feels like it could be done better? What then?</p>\n<p>In a couple of months I will be 24 years old. I will not have solved any significant problem. I&#8217;ve seen many, but I simply won&#8217;t have solved any. The thing with time and aging is that you can only do so much. You have to pick. Even if you see many things that <em>need</em> to be improved; and you can fix a small subset of them. You still have to pick.</p>\n<p>Time is a bitch like that.</p>\n<p>I can swallow the fact that because I have Better Things &#8482; to do I will likely never go to all the best parties, see all the best clubs and go to all the best concerts. I will never get to wake up with my head in Janis Joplin&#8217;s lap. I will [likely] never have quite solved that <a href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/doing-a-startup-taught-me-the-value-of-staying-in-school/swizec/1819\">information overload problem I was working on</a> that one time &#8230;</p>\n<p>There is a popular saying on 4chan &#8220;Regret nothing. At one point it was exactly what you wanted.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A brilliant quote to keep us reminded that life is pretty much at our mercy. Not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Then again, what if &#8220;it&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly what you wanted? Maybe it&#8217;s just the most achievable option. Or it might be a bitter step on your path to what you want etc. Maybe you had ten options and simply had to pick one. Or maybe you&#8217;re just a farmer somewhere in Africa and no matter what you want, circumstance has made the choices for you.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m raising a lot of questions here &#8230; the point I&#8217;m getting at is that having a sort of entrepreneurial mindset can be/is a total drag. Always seeing ways to improve things and knowing you&#8217;ll never get to improve them &#8230; sucks.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://blogs.constantcontact.com/commentary/for-entrepreneurs-theres-a-fine-line-between-good-and-bad/\">For Entrepreneurs, There&#8217;s a Fine Line Between Good and Bad</a> (blogs.constantcontact.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://www.icemanbaldy.com/icemanbaldy/2011/05/seven-types-of-entrepreneurs-seven-sins-of-entrepreneurship.html\">Seven Types of Entrepreneurs, Seven Sins of Entrepreneurship</a> (icemanbaldy.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://owengreaves.com/the-curse-of-the-entrepreneur/\">The Curse Of The Entrepreneur</a> (owengreaves.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2015570849_siliconstatus11.html?syndication=rss\">Young tech millionaires keeping 1-bedroom lifestyle</a> (seattletimes.nwsource.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=fed1fdc3-0f11-436a-bf85-0fedbf9618f8\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"734f1cfe-1fab-5cfb-98e5-6e653d27679f"}}
