If you have a website and it doesn&#8217;t offer some kind of API then you&#8217;re an idiot these days. One of those people stuck in the past. For the purpose of this swapping generalisation let&#8217;s assume an <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"RSS\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS\">RSS</a> is a sort of basic API.</p>\n<p>When everything has an API it&#8217;s very easy to create mashups, connect services and sometimes even create something wonderful &#8211; like for example the whole ecosystem <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitter\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter\">Twitter</a> has become.</p>\n<p>However, there is a dark side to this intercommingling of everything. There are two actually, but I&#8217;ll focus on the first for now.</p>\n<p>What happens when a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Service provider\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_provider\">service provider</a> decides to discontinue their API support? Or what happens when somebody begins a lock down procedure to improve their own profitability? Darker still, what when the provider&#8217;s official API users automagically work and everybody else is in a sea of inexplicable trouble?</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"display: block; width: 250px; margin: 1em; float: left;\">\n<div>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 250px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34815016@N02/3814748024/\"><img title=\"the Machine\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2569/3814748024_b56e8f68f3_m.jpg\" alt=\"the Machine\" /></a></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd zemanta-img-attribution\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">Image by <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/34815016@N02/3814748024/\">Robb North</a> via Flickr</dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Something similar happened to me yesterday night as I was readying <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Twitulater\" rel=\"blog\" href=\"http://twitulater.com\">Twitulater</a> for release. I only had a few touch-ups to do here and there. But something dark and brooding came in between. Something drove a wedge right through my plans and slaughtered them whole.</p>\n<p>I was chatting to my girlfriend and wanted to give her a prank link. What better way to prank someone than first shortening the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Uniform Resource Locator\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator\">URL</a> via a shortening service. I opted for my favourite, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"tr.im URLs\" rel=\"blog\" href=\"http://tr.im/\">tr.im</a>. But alas, the page greeted me with a warning only. It said they were unable to find a revenue stream and were simply shutting down, effective immediately.</p>\n<p>Luckily they pointed to another good provider, <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"bit.ly\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.bit.ly\">bit.ly</a>, through which I could then shorten my url.</p>\n<p>But this left Twitulater in a dark spot, our primary and default url shortener didn&#8217;t work. What now!? Well, I was up until about 4am that night, implementing bit.ly support. This of course wasn&#8217;t easy, it could be easy, but it wasn&#8217;t. For some reason bit.ly wants you to provide a username and a key and other strange things before you can use their API &#8211; on native Twitter of course it just automagically works.</p>\n<p>So in the end, because one service shut down and another is a bit silly with authentication, I was left with a very delayed release schedule and a <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Usability\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability\">usability</a> nightmare hidden inside my application, for anyone to discover when they post a link.</p>\n<p>Thus I propose a question to everyone, are we becoming too reliant on open API&#8217;s?</p>\n<p>PS: it has just come to my attention through the Zemanta plugin that tr.im decided not to die after all.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/325dc03f-6c33-4653-9d9f-31feb6a3288b/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=325dc03f-6c33-4653-9d9f-31feb6a3288b\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"836f14d9-0a54-520a-8d6a-41a062d1f7c5"}}
