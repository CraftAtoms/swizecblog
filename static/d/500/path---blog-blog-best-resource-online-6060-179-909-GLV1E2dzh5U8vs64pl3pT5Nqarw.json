Wat.</p>\n<p>Out of all the other websites on the internet, Google has decided that my blog is the single best resource possible to learn about &#8220;60*60&#8221;. I… thanks?</p>\n<p>The experiment even reproduces! I googled incognito, I had my friends google it, I even googled on my girlfriend&#8217;s laptop to make sure it&#8217;s not a programmer thing. Swizec.com is first result. It’s the best thing out there.</p>\n<p>Better even than <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60x60\">wikipedia&#8217;s page titled 60&#215;60</a>. Or the <em>60 Minutes</em> account on Twitter.</p>\n<p>If you wanna learn about 60*60, come to my site. I gotchu, fam. Apparently &#8230;</p>\n<h3>Doing the SEO</h3>\n<p>I have no idea how Google decided I&#8217;m an expert on multiplying 60 by 60, but I can tell you this: I don&#8217;t know how SEO works. It sounds like black magic to me.</p>\n<p>My search engine optimization strategy goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Publish stuff</li>\n<li>Avoid fanciness, make site readable (i.e. use WordPress)</li>\n<li>???</li>\n<li>60% organic search traffic</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Maybe this is a strategy that works. Maybe I got lucky. Maybe it&#8217;s because my blog has been alive for 10 years. Maybe it works because I keep posting. Maybe all of that.</p>\n<p>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/JzmiLpw.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>Organic search drives 60% of my traffic, 14.7% comes from untraceable sources<sup><a href=\"#fn1-2164\" id=\"fnr1-2164\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>, 12% social, 11% referral<sup><a href=\"#fn2-2164\" id=\"fnr2-2164\" title=\"see footnote\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, and a teeeeeeny tiiiny little sliver of email &#8211; 1.5%. That&#8217;s 490 people in the past 30 days.</p>\n<p>Like so many people from email.</p>\n<p>So why am I spending so much emotional energy on email? The weekly newsletters, the subscribe forms, the sinking feeling that every unsubscribe brings. And for what? Less than 2% of all traffic.</p>\n<p>Silly.</p>\n<p>And yet, when an email goes out, there&#8217;s an uptick in traffic, an uptick in comments, an uptick in sales. An uptick in just about everything.</p>\n<p>So what the hell is all that organic traffic doing?</p>\n<p>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p>\n<p>Oh, I guess my advice to you is <em>if you want SEO, have something for people to find.</em> Nothing you do will work if there&#8217;s nothing for Google to find. SEO is a dead industry. Don&#8217;t even sweat about it. Just have good shit for people to find.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2164\">\n<p>I call &#8220;direct&#8221; untraceable because it could mean a lot of things.
