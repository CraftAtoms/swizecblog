This 3D stuff is way too hard. None of this makes any sense to me anymore.</p>\n<p>All I wanted to do today was make a nice little hurricane travel across an augmented reality marker. In theory, all you need for that is a nice particle system and some parameter tweaking. Instead of particles flying around randomly, you want them to twirl around in a cone shape of some sort.</p>\n<p>But nooooâ€¦</p>\n<p>We tried with <a href=\"https://github.com/IdeaSpaceVR/aframe-particle-system-component\">aframe-particle-system-component</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/particles-1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7788\" />\n<p>That did not quite work.</p>\n<p>Then we searched for <a href=\"https://threejs.org/examples/\">three.js examples</a> that looked close enough that they could be a hurricane with some param tweaking. The closest we could find was the <a href=\"https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_gpu_particle_system\">GPU Particle System example</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s got everything we need:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Many particles</li>\n<li>Particles follow some sort of wind pattern</li>\n<li>Parameters to tweak</li>\n</ol>\n<img src=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gpu-particles-system-1024x687.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7789\" srcset=\"https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gpu-particles-system-1024x687.gif 1024w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gpu-particles-system-300x201.gif 300w, https://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gpu-particles-system-768x515.gif 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" />\n<p>Turning it into an <a href=\"https://aframe.io/\">aframe component</a> for <a href=\"https://github.com/Swizec/ar-js-experiment\">our setup</a> should be easy. Aframe is an abstraction on top of Three.js, after all.</p>\n<p><em>In theory</em>, all you have to do is to register a new Aframe component, put your example initiation into <code>init()</code>, and your animation stuff into <code>tick()</code>. Instead of rendering with the Three.js renderer, you <code>setObject3D</code> on the Aframe object.</p>\n<pre lang=\"javascript\">\nAFRAME.registerComponent('hurricane', {\n    scheme: {},\n    init: function () {\n        // initiation code\n    },\n    tick: function (now, delta) {\n        // animation code\n    }\n});\n</pre>\n<p>Then you could use it like this: <code>&lt;Entity hurricane /&gt;</code>, or without JSX, like this: <code>&lt;a-entity hurricane /&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p>It didn&#8217;t work. We tried fiddling with it and changing things here and there and nothing worked. No matter what, nothing showed up on screen.</p>\n<p>In a final act of defiance, we found this cool <a href=\"https://github.com/feiss/aframe-environment-component\">aframe-environment-component</a> and put a giant mushroom forest around our Minecraft guy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">But this is cool too <a href=\"https://t.co/hjdUKhnEyY\">pic.twitter.com/hjdUKhnEyY</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Swizec (@Swizec) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Swizec/status/907022919028457472\">September 10, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p>I guess that&#8217;s cool, too. I dunno, I&#8217;m kinda disappointed. I was hoping we could build something cool, but this whole 3D-on-the-web business is almost as big a mess as all the D3 examples you find out there.</p>\n<p>What is it with everybody who writes these examples and relying on global variables for everything? Use function arguments, damn it! That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re there for ðŸ˜–</p>\n<p>And what&#8217;s with all the imperative code? Everything is just add this and this and this and then change this and that. How am I supposed to understand what&#8217;s going on?</p>\n<p>Ugh &#8230; we&#8217;ll play with something new next week. Any suggestions?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"33cf1a8b-f9ab-5fa2-9c50-67d860f8472a"}}
