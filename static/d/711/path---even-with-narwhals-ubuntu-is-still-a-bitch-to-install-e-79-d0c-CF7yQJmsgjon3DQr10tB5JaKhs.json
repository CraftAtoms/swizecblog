He doesn&#8217;t have a [real] battery. He&#8217;s a desktop computer.</p>\n<p>Obviously because he has a pretty big role in my access to the internets and I have a laptop that can take care of my everyday needs I didn&#8217;t really feel like going through the pain of fixing Lestat. But because this is a holiday sort of week in Slovenia and everything is pretty damn slow I went ahead and decided to upgrade whichever <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/kubuntu\" title=\"Kubuntu\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.kubuntu.org\">Kubuntu</a> was running to the new <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/ubuntu\" title=\"Ubuntu (operating system)\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu</a> Natty Narwhal.</p>\n<p>Two days before the final version came out. Yep, totally.</p>\n<p>Ditching <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/kde\" title=\"KDE\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.kde.org/\">KDE</a> for the new Unity desktop was a particularly hard decision, but I wanted to go with pure Ubuntu because Kubuntu usually lags a bit in stability and is usually just messier around release time.</p>\n<p>Lot of good that did.</p>\n<p>Obviously when I started installing everything went to shit as usual and what shouldn&#8217;t have taken longer than an hour or so ended up burning four hours and still isn&#8217;t quite done. I wonder if the next Ubuntu will come out sooner than I&#8217;ll be done with perfectly setting this thing up.</p>\n<p>First I tried to just do a normal install, but god forbid you don&#8217;t have an internet connection, it pretends like it&#8217;s going to work, but it doesn&#8217;t. So then the next obvious choice was figuring out how to get <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/point-to-point_protocol_over_ethernet\" title=\"Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-Point_Protocol_over_Ethernet\">PPPoE</a> working &#8230; as simple as the <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/networkmanager\" title=\"NetworkManager\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://projects.gnome.org/NetworkManager/\">NetworkManager</a> thing is, I never quite trust <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/graphical_user_interface\" title=\"Graphical user interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\">GUI</a> tools on linux. There&#8217;s no telling what they&#8217;ll do.</p>\n<p>And in fact later on when I tried to set it up as a router, yep, can&#8217;t do that through the GUI. But if you try to mix old school and GUI it just doesn&#8217;t work. Wtf. Thanks a lot GUI!? What happened to the good old days when you were just a config generator and wrote it down to the same file as a normal person would?</p>\n<p>Actually I still have to do a bunch of manual wiggling around and contortionist acts whenever I reboot Lestat &#8230; hopefully I can get this figured out soon. You&#8217;d think it would be easier to set up a router from ppp0 to eth0 with a firewall in between &#8230;</p>\n<p>The next thing that went utterly wrong was admittedly my fault. I forgot that I had used an encrypted home directory and now not only can I magically not get to  many of my old files &#8230; /home is on the same partition as the system. Crap.</p>\n<p>I would totally expect &#8220;Install new Ubuntu&#8221; option to at least <em>ask</em> whether I might like /home on a different partition than everything else. That&#8217;s just common courtesy &#8230; or rather, that should simply be the default.</p>\n<p>And finally we have Unity, the wonderful new desktop.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div style=\"width: 250px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/21729803@N07/5661243342\"><img title=\"IMG_1485\" src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5025/5661243342_e3be998461_m.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_1485\" width=\"240\" height=\"160\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image by 孤雲出岫 Free Cloud via Flickr</p></div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I like it.</p>\n<p>The music player is crap compared to Amarok2, the launcher simply doesn&#8217;t work very well and the dock is a clear ripoff from <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/mac_os\" title=\"Mac OS\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/macosx/\">MacOS</a> &#8230; except I can&#8217;t quite figure out how to customize it and on my Mac I can.</p>\n<p>Another thing that I&#8217;ve gotten very used to on KDE4 and haven&#8217;t quite figured out here yet are the desktop widgets &#8230; does Unity have something like that? I should do some poking around &#8230;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all bad though, I love how integrated the system-wide sound controls and Banshee the music player are. That&#8217;s just epic and I heart it very much. The social media geek in me also just adores the fact that everything comes neatly integrated with Twitter and Facebook. It&#8217;s just right there! Yay.</p>\n<p>Oh and the other launcher, the one with oh so many app icons is brilliant for not-power-users. The fact it also shows &#8220;hey, you might like these apps too&#8221; is a brilliant way to introduce people to the concept of a package manager. It&#8217;s the kind of brilliance I&#8217;d expect from the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mac App Store\" rel=\"homepage\" href=\"http://www.apple.com/mac/app-store\">Mac App Store</a> &#8230; in fact, the new package manager GUI is leaps and bounds ahead of anything Apple has produced so far for App management.</p>\n<p>Shame on you apple! A bunch of opensource geeks outdid you!</p>\n<p>Hmm &#8230; maybe that&#8217;s a blogpost for another day, so nicely flamewar inspiring I just cannot resist.</p>\n<p>Oh and what I love the most? I can finally listen to music on my sound system rather than the laptop speakers. Yay!</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://sandeepbhalla.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/partitioninghomemoving-community-ubuntu-documentation/\">Partitioning/Home/Moving &#8211; Community Ubuntu Documentation</a> (sandeepbhalla.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://doctormo.org/2011/04/25/narwhals-art-and-april-2011/\">Martin Owens: Narwhals, Art and April 2011</a> (doctormo.org)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://chedean.com/2011/04/14/ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal-beta-2-has-been-released/\">Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) Beta 2 Has Been Released</a> (chedean.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://flossstuff.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal-release-date-28th-april/\">Ubuntu 11.04 &#8220;Natty Narwhal&#8221; &#8211; Release Date 28th April</a> (flossstuff.wordpress.com)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://donatoroque.wordpress.com/2011/04/15/ubuntu-11-04-natty-narwhal-is-nice/\">Ubuntu 11.04 Natty Narwhal Is Nice</a> (donatoroque.wordpress.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=1b1f1a3a-0aeb-4d9d-9347-e872ea4c603c\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related more-info pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0fdd464c-c2ba-58d1-a696-4e0b5255c0d7"}}
