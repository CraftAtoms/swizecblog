{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"2018 is off to a rocky start","content":"<img src=\"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03167/Only-Fools-and-Hor_3167098b.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Fools_and_Horses\">Only Fools and Horses</a> Del Boy was a successful businessman with a cashflow problem. Always up to some scheme or another, always on the verge of <em>&#8220;This time next year, we&#8217;ll be millionaires!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how I feel at the start of 2018. Many irons in the fire, not much happening.</p>\n<p>Sidehustle is down to half a month&#8217;s runway. About $900 in the bank.</p>\n<p>Thanks to some luck in timing, it&#8217;s going to last a month. Already paid everything for this month.</p>\n<p>Book sales are tanking, mind is preoccupied with other projects, day job startup is growing in needs. It&#8217;s starting to take off and I gotta keep things running on my end. Stressful.</p>\n<p>I think the sidehustle made around $1800 in sales for January. Haven&#8217;t had time to count. Thank god for marketing automation.</p>\n<p>People don&#8217;t usually write articles about this point in their business. That&#8217;s why I am. It&#8217;s a roller coaster, ups followed by downs.</p>\n<h2>Cashflow kills businesses</h2>\n<p>Did you know <a href=\"http://time.com/money/3888448/cash-flow-small-business-startups/\">cashflow kills 25% of small businesses</a>? This stuff gets real tricky real fast.</p>\n<p>So here I am, a month of money in the bank, a few huge expenses coming down the pipe[^1], and enough outstanding-but-not-yet-cash things to make your eyes water.</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, I didn&#8217;t mention those before did I?</p>\n<p>You know how <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/teaching-backend-devs-react-redux-stubhub-boston/swizec/7952\">I did that workshop in December</a>? Still no cash. Corporations are hard. After 50 days the invoice has entered processing. Now what happens I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m not even the point person on this. I just wait.</p>\n<p>And you know how <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/data-visualization-d3js\">I published Data Visualization With D3.js </a> through Packt a few years ago? Some of my words got used for a <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/d3js-4x-data-visualization-third-edition\">subsequent edition</a> last year and I&#8217;m credited as coauthor.</p>\n<p>I get royalties for all of that.</p>\n<p>Except I don&#8217;t because Packt has had the wrong bank details and that money never reached me. I didn&#8217;t notice for 2 years! 2 years!</p>\n<p>Packt sent royalty statements. <em>&#8220;We will pay you thiiiiiis much&#8221;</em>. Packt sent money. Money bounced and went back to them. They didn&#8217;t tell me. 2 fucking years and not a word.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a few thousand dollars and they assure me it&#8217;s coming February 15th for sure.</p>\n<p>¬Ø&#92;_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</p>\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5wayr6tYzY&amp;t=1s\">Big Deal I alluded to in a recent vlog</a>. I don&#8217;t wanna jinx it before money hits account but, damn.</p>\n<img src=\"https://memegenerator.net/img/instances/500x/62709854/damn-girl-you-thicker-than-a-bowl-of-oatmeal.jpg\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>There&#8217;s a word to describe this situation. It&#8217;s called stressful.</p>\n<h2>Wait, didn&#8217;t you just brag about making bank last year?</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a roller coaster. Things go up. Things go down. Observers don&#8217;t notice because ups get likes, downs do not.</p>\n<p>Algorithms then hide the downs because of low engagement and everyone thinks everyone is always crushing it. We&#8217;re not. Nobody is <em>always</em> crushing it.</p>\n<p>No matter what GaryVee wants you to think.</p>\n<p>I did write about <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/how-i-sidehustled-72167-last-year-and-what-i-wanna-do-next/swizec/8016\">having a damn good year</a>. But I got excited with my accounting and I&#8217;m still waiting to get some $10,000 of that. Oops.</p>\n<p>As my first ever freelancing client used to say: <em>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe in money until it&#8217;s in my bank account&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>He was right. Don&#8217;t count your money before it&#8217;s yours.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the sidehustle was living large in December. Got a <a href=\"https://swizec.com/blog/new-5k-monitor-lg-ultrafine-5k/swizec/7955\">nice new monitor</a>, spotted the girlfriend some cash for a new laptop, gave my freelancers nice Christmas bonuses, prepaid a bunch of stuff for 2018, paid some taxes in advance &#8230; it adds up.</p>\n<p>You might think that was stupid, but it wasn&#8217;t. Just aggressive.</p>\n<p>You see, spending &#8220;excess&#8221; money in one tax year on things that benefit you in the next year is a cashflow management strategy. You invest in the business and it lowers your taxes for this year and lowers your operating expenses for next year.</p>\n<p>Spend the money when you have it, not when you don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>If you keep it, then next year you&#8217;re going to both pay a lot to the IRS <em>and</em> still have to pay for the things you need. Double whammy.</p>\n<p>Wouldn&#8217;t you rather just have the things you need? I would.</p>\n<h2>So whatchu gonna do?</h2>\n<p>Well, there&#8217;s two ways a product business makes more money.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get more leads.</li>\n<li>Build new products.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Time to clean up the distractions and focus on those two. The money will come. Follow the process. üôèüèª</p>\n<p>Not much I can do about the money that&#8217;s already on the way. I can wait, maybe send some emails. Good thing I put some money away when times were good so I can cover the cashflow hole while I wait.</p>\n<p>Ever heard of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ant_and_the_Grasshopper\">the grasshopper and the ant</a>? Save for a rainy day. It <em>will</em> come.</p>\n<p>[^1] Maybe not huge for you but huge for me, a few thousand dollars are gonna go <em>poof</em> for some important things. I&#8217;ll talk about it when that story concludes.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"196698c8-7625-59fe-ba27-b8860f9c0684"}}
