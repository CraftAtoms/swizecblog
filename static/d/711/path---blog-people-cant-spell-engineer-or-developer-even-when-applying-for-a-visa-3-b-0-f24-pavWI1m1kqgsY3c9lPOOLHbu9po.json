{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"People can&#8217;t spell &#8220;engineer&#8221; or &#8220;developer&#8221; even when applying for a visa","content":"<img alt=\"Funny engineer spelling\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/27491?token=VIeaOVOPeTZ-MEvqx03RYMD7exFbCnIxrTrpyZLMN8CcgZuZrQKphAxSgypAsaDZAeeMczdNrb4dsXWlLAtgZzY\" />\n<p>A couple weeks ago I published a visualization of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"H-1B visa\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-1B_visa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">H1B</a> salaries in the <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Software industry\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_industry\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">software industry</a>. You should check it out, <a href=\"http://swizec.github.io/h1b-software-salaries/#2014-ca-engineer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It was a smashing success with some 46k visitors. Yay!</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s talk about how fuzzy the data was. Especially the job title part. Like, people just don&#8217;t care enough to spell O.o</p>\n<p>A visa application is no joke, right? It&#8217;s an official document, that&#8217;s going to be read by government employees. It&#8217;s the kind of thing where submitting a week before the deadline is late.</p>\n<p>And your document is judged. Harshly. People hire lawyers just to make sure all their paperwork is in order. That the t&#8217;s are crossed and the i&#8217;s are dotted.</p>\n<p>You wouldn&#8217;t expect spelling mistakes to make it through, right?</p>\n<p>Wellp &#8230;</p>\n<p>I found many spellings for <code><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Engineer\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">engineer</a></code>. Everything from the correct <code>engineer</code> to the silly <code>eingineeerr</code>. But most got the first three letters right. The normalization regex is just <code>/eng|enig|ening|eign/</code>.</p>\n<p>Well &#8230; maybe counting on the first three letters is pushing it.</p>\n<p>The more troubling fact is that people haven&#8217;t mastered spaces very well. Or my scraping script hasn&#8217;t. But a large part of the data assumes <code>engineer</code> is a grammatical prefix (or suffix) to whatever your real job entails.</p>\n<p>I saw everything from <code>engineerprogrammer</code> to <code>engineerjava</code>.</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s give people some credit, engineer is a pretty darn difficult word to spell. It&#8217;s practically latin throws the usual <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"English phonology\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">English phonetics</a> out the door.</p>\n<p>The word <code>developer</code> though &#8230; Here&#8217;s the regex I had to use: <code>/develop|dvelop|develp|devlp|devel|deelop|devlop|devleo|deveo/</code></p>\n<img alt=\":|\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/27490?token=0EvLPL-0lqrNTTsY2Fg7rIEP2QGakG9F6r_0YQvDELyP4BTeAoli2upgqTKfBZ7vm5OuHRMxDhZWhy9J-FoMpws\" />\n<p>Yeah &#8230; I don&#8217;t even know. Like, seriously, I just don&#8217;t know. How?</p>\n<p>Everything from <code>developer</code> to <code>development</code>, both of which are good, to the silly <code>developor</code>, and <code>devloper</code>.</p>\n<p>And once more, a bunch of datapoints using it as a prefix &#8230; maybe that&#8217;s my bad though. Surely it&#8217;s my bad. Surely it just means <code>.split()</code> isn&#8217;t the best word <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Lexical analysis\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">tokenizer</a>.</p>\n<p>Surely.</p>\n<p>Perhaps most interesting fact, though, is that the 81,122 visas in my dataset include 3,558 different job titles. Counting misspellings.</p>\n<p>3,558 different job titles. Job titles I normalized to just 11 categories.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a hell of a lot of ways to say &#8220;person creating business value by getting computers to do stuff&#8221;. No matter which way you cut it.</p>\n<p>PS: if you take away rejected visas, there are only 3,472 job titles left. I wonder how many vanished due to spelling.</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6b3ce489-2c63-5f5b-ba30-02ba3a8c8498"}}
