There was a great deal of tweeting my yesterday&#8217;s blogpost about how <a title=\"My ideas are shitty so Iâ€™m going on an internet diet\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/my-ideas-are-shitty-so-im-going-on-an-internet-diet/swizec/2239\">my ideas are shit and I&#8217;m going on an internet diet</a>.</p>\n<p>There were also 127 upvotes on hackernews and 80+ comments. The only time something like that has happened on my blog before was when <a title=\"Appleâ€™s Ping is a big pile of steaming dung\" href=\"http://swizec.com/blog/apples-ping-is-a-big-pile-of-steaming-dung/swizec/1444\">I pissed all over Apple&#8217;s Ping</a>.</p>\n<p>I also learned that apparently through some fluke or stupidity neither google analytics nor mixpanel were loading on the blog all day. Therefore I have no proper way of telling how many people read that post and what&#8217;s most unfortunate, my mixpanel tracking of how far people scroll down my page &#8230;</p>\n<p>But! My cool sysadmin has a stats thing and from what I can tell, there were 20,000 people or thereabouts reading the blog yesterday. This is particularly epic since my goal for this year is to build the blog up so much I have 20k monthly visitors. ðŸ˜€</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"77265863-d78f-5bc2-83e2-3d463c8692d7"}}
