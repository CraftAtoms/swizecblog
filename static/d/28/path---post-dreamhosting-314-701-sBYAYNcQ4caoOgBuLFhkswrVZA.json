{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"Dreamhosting","content":"<p>\nA few days ago I got kind of fed up of relying on a free hosting service provided me by my friends at <a href=\"http://unimatrix-one.org/\" target=\"_blank\">unimatrix-one</a> and shelved out the moneys needed for <a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dreamhost</a>. It&#39;s surprisingly little for what you actually get if you ask me.\n</p>\n<p>\nUpon registering I was offered a <a href=\"http://3pike.org/\" target=\"_blank\">free domain</a> to go with the hosting and having no better ideas at the time I did what any geek with a girlfriend would do. I made a <a href=\"http://3pike.org/\" target=\"_blank\">domain</a> out of my wench&#39;s nickname. Sure, at first I did intend it to be her blog because she is using something completely unfit for a geek&#39;s girlfriend, but as she said she doesn&#39;t need one I put up a <a href=\"http://3pike.org/\" target=\"_blank\">picture</a> of her. She loved the gesture, hates the picture &#8230; and that&#39;s exactly why I chose that particular one.\n</p>\n<p>\nAs for <a href=\"http://www.dreamhost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">dreamhost</a>, they seem quite nice so far. Responsiveness is superbly quick and I have more space than I could ever imagine I&#39;d need, with said space increasing weekly, amazing. The monthly, I think it&#39;s monthly, transfer is also something I will probably never exceed &#8230; and also increases weekly. Should the need ever arise I can even get a dedicated host &#8230; lovely.\n</p>\n<p>\nSo yeah, so far I&#39;m pleased with dreamhost and it gave me a fun day, because what better can a geek want than a completely new hosting account to play with and set stuff up?</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2af9bf47-85fb-5e12-a754-1b944dec8931"}}
