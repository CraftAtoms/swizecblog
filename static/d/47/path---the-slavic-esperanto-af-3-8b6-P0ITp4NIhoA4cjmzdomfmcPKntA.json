My linguistic geek slips out.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that one! Linguistic geekdom! All over the place! Like a vulgar Andy Warhol rip off painted on a pornstar&#8217;s fake boobs.</p>\n<p>So last time that happened it was because I stumbled upon something called a Slovianski Jezik, which is apparently something not unlike an <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/esperanto\" title=\"Esperanto\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto\">Esperanto</a> exclusively for slavic languages.</p>\n<p>Of course I went full monty on it and was all like &#8220;Omigosh omigosh this is liek SO brilliant yeah!?&#8221; in my best <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/cockney\" title=\"Cockney\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockney\">cockney accent</a> impersonation.</p>\n<p>But the thing is that, all joking aside, us <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/slavic_peoples\" title=\"Slavic peoples\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_peoples\">slavs</a> are in dire need of a language such as this. The most painful thing we have to deal with is that already, as it is, in our natural state, it&#8217;s almost like we were talking dialects of the same language. Well not really, but still, there are many many similarities.</p>\n<p>Like I&#8217;ve read once that <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/slavic_languages\" title=\"Slavic languages\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavic_languages\">Slavic languages</a> are the only family of languages in the world where speakers talking to one another feel like the other person <em>should</em> be understandable, but has such a horrible <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/speech_disorder\" title=\"Speech disorder\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disorder\">speech impediment</a> that they just can&#8217;t quite make them out. Combined with regional differences in vocabulary and you&#8217;re in a fucked up situation where you instinctively feel like you should be able to converse normally &#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230; but just can&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>For example I went to <a class=\"zem_slink freebase/en/prague\" title=\"Prague\" rel=\"geolocation\" href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=50.0833333333,14.4166666667&amp;spn=0.1,0.1&amp;q=50.0833333333,14.4166666667 (Prague)&amp;t=h\">Prague</a> last week. When there I could almost understand everything I saw in written language and could understand something like 50% of the things I was told. 70% when I tried really hard.</p>\n<p>But as soon as I tried to do some proper communication there was a big fail and we were all forced to default back to English, which is just horrible. Come on, a Slovenian and a Czech conversing in a stupid germanic language. EW!</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"margin: 1em; float: left;\">\n<div>\n<dl>\n<dt><a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AndyWarholBridgePittsburgh.JPG\"><img src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/300px-AndyWarholBridgePittsburgh.jpg\" alt=\"The Andy Warhol Bridge (7th Street) Bridge in ...\" width=\"300\" height=\"155\" /></a></dt>\n<dd>Image via <a href=\"http://commons.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:AndyWarholBridgePittsburgh.JPG\">Wikipedia</a></dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>That&#8217;s where Slovianski comes in. It is specifically designed to be instantly and intuitively intelligible to anyone who understands slavic languages, more specifically, anyone who is a Slav. You can try this on the <a href=\"http://steen.free.fr/slovianski/\" target=\"_blank\">Slovianski language front page</a></p>\n<p>Personally I can make out just about everything it says. Even when a word is missing I can very simply understand it from the context.</p>\n<p>This is without ever having learnt any other Slavic languages than Slovene and I guess I learned some Serbocroatian by ear simply from &#8230; well those who know why know, the rest don&#8217;t really have to know.</p>\n<p>I think every Slav out there should learn this language, I sure know I want to. It looks easy enough anyway.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/2835fdd5-913c-44aa-9cc0-aad198cf3470/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=2835fdd5-913c-44aa-9cc0-aad198cf3470\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f6ea1fa8-fb2e-512c-8abe-d9dff5d9d815"}}
