Wow! I haven&#8217;t done this since &#8230; well I&#8217;ve never done it to be honest. The reason why I did it is even more mindbogglingly strange &#8211; I wanted to go see the movie solely because I used to read <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Neil Gaiman\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gaiman\">Neil Gaiman</a>&#8216;s blog and he seemed like a cool cat and talked a lot about how Coraline the movie is being made after one of his stories.</p>\n<p>It did not disappoint.</p>\n<p>Sure I haven&#8217;t read the book, but the movie was absolutely wonderful and its wikipedia page says there aren&#8217;t many distinctions from the book. Perhaps the most notable is the invention of a Wyborne character who seemed quite crucial to the plot in the movie so I have no idea how Neil managed without him &#8230;</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-img\" style=\"margin: 1em; display: block;\">\n<div>\n<dl class=\"wp-caption alignleft\" style=\"width: 310px;\">\n<dt class=\"wp-caption-dt\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Coraline_preview_shot.PNG\"><img title=\"Coraline as depicted in the film.\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/49/Coraline_preview_shot.PNG/300px-Coraline_preview_shot.PNG\" alt=\"Coraline as depicted in the film.\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" /></a></dt>\n<dd class=\"wp-caption-dd zemanta-img-attribution\" style=\"font-size: 0.8em;\">Image via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Coraline_preview_shot.PNG\">Wikipedia</a></dd>\n</dl>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Deciding to watch Coraline in XpanD and the lovely three dimensional thingamagic also turned out to be a stroke of genius. All of the effects were tasteful done and I could identify only two or three scenes that were 3-D porn. This, to me, is something that really sets Coraline apart from all the other <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"3-D film\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_film\">3D movies</a> I&#8217;d seen, which were thin on the plot, empty on the characters and drowning on 3D porn.</p>\n<p>There really isn&#8217;t anything I can find to criticise about this movie,the art was awesome, the story was great and the characters were spectacular. Even the soundtrack was bloody magnificent &#8230;</p>\n<p>&#8230; ah yes, but there is one thing. There is a scene with dancing mice that purports to be <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Stop motion\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion\">stop-motion animation</a> done with 64 or so figures moving simultaneously on stage and thus being a magnificent exampleof just how much awesome this movie is. However, watching the scene gave me an uneasy sensation of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Computer-generated imagery\" rel=\"wikipedia\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated_imagery\">CGI</a> repetition. They just moved too unanimously to look real and even their movement seemed rushed. Looked like frames kept being skipped.</p>\n<p>All in all though, the movie is bloody awesome and I think everyone even remotely interested in proper cinematography should go see it.</p>\n<h6 class=\"zemanta-related-title\" style=\"font-size: 1em;\">Related articles by Zemanta</h6>\n<ul class=\"zemanta-article-ul\">\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/5307595/Coraline-animation-by-Neil-Gaiman.html&amp;a=4914591&amp;rid=c6070e25-b70f-4e8f-be5d-11dde4467ba5&amp;e=f1fd59e7673e76a57fa9dbf2309c90db\"> Coraline: animation by Neil Gaiman </a> (telegraph.co.uk)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://r.zemanta.com/?u=http%3A//www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturecritics/timrobey/5291822/Coraline-review.html&amp;a=4736165&amp;rid=c6070e25-b70f-4e8f-be5d-11dde4467ba5&amp;e=7d30c4efc20440a19f41d61447f71801\"> Coraline review </a> (telegraph.co.uk)</li>\n<li class=\"zemanta-article-ul-li\"><a href=\"http://splashpage.mtv.com/2009/05/19/neil-gaimans-coraline-gets-musical-treatment-new-interpretation/\"> Neil Gaiman&#8217;s &#8216;Coraline&#8217; Gets Musical Treatment, New Interpretation </a> (splashpage.mtv.com)</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" href=\"http://reblog.zemanta.com/zemified/c6070e25-b70f-4e8f-be5d-11dde4467ba5/\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/reblog_e.png?x-id=c6070e25-b70f-4e8f-be5d-11dde4467ba5\" alt=\"Reblog this post [with Zemanta]\" /></a><span class=\"zem-script more-related pretty-attribution\"><script src=\"http://static.zemanta.com/readside/loader.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></span></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ad27bd87-3bbe-5c53-8fe2-cac428371b3f"}}
