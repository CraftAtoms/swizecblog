One day it was April, and the next it was June.</p>\n<p>Whooosh like a deadline!</p>\n<p>Most of the month went towards building a React Native Music App: <a href=\"https://school.shoutem.com/lectures/build-react-native-music-app-tutorial-part1/\">Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://school.shoutem.com/lectures/react-native-soundcloud-streaming-app-tutorial-part-2/\">Part 2</a>. Subscribers on the React Native School project still aren&#8217;t growing as fast as I&#8217;d like. Gonna have to figure something out.</p>\n<p>I think a combination of viral loops and better signup forms is necessary. The articles are long, so I don&#8217;t think most people even scroll down to the form.</p>\n<p>Another big portion of the month went towards completing <a href=\"https://gum.co/mTWg\">React + D3v4</a>. IT IS FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE &#92;o/</p>\n<p>What remains is to test drive it, turn it into a course, polish the intro and outro texts, make a new landing page, update the offerings, spruce up some ads, update the email crash course, write an email launch sequence. Stuff like that.</p>\n<p>Y&#8217;know, the hard stuff, now that the fun stuff is done üôÇ</p>\n<p>This focus on not-published-on-swizec.com content meant there was less traffic, which resulted in lower sales. As you can read in the numbers below.</p>\n<p>Might also be time to organize another workshop.

There was one video game; inspiration and relaxation, totally serious business expense. And a new carry-on suitcase because I got a discount. Super necessary.</p>\n<p>But what was the other $200‚Ä¶ I need to take better notes.</p>\n<p>On the bright side, swizec.com is securely mine for another 5 years. That was def worth the price.</p>\n<p>Does a marketing course count as an expense? Pretty sure Starbucks wouldn&#8217;t pay for that if I was a barista, but my sidehustle did because my sidehustle values me as a gentleman and a scholar.</p>\n<p>ü§î</p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"efdd4957-8817-55b6-b464-90aac23f1c07"}}
