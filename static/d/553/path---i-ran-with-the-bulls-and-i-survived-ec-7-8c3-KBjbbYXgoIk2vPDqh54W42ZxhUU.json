Every each person here is fucked in the head.</em></p>\n<p>We were about to run with the bulls. A crowd some two or three hundred strong &#8211; waiting for the announcer to start the countdown; the cowboys to corral twenty-eight 2,000 pound beasts towards us at speeds up to 35 miles per hour.</p>\n<p>What the fuck was I thinking? Running with the bulls? This is pointless, stupid, and completely insane.</p>\n<p>No time to think, countdown&#8217;s started. I&#8217;d been looking forward to this for weeks. Let&#8217;s go!</p>\n<div style=\"width: 650px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Closest the bulls got to me\" alt=\"Closest the bulls got to me\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/18567?token=AwIpz_3OtuVKys0-waBU_Gw1X_iKgMhXpI_0fVzzRQfI0kxLCZ_dIou5_v28fLttasH9Ewwu25dYUARYE6L7gyM\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Closest the bulls got to me</p></div>\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much a run, as it was nearly peeing your pants in excitement while you wait for the bulls to get close, running a few steps terrified that somebody is going to cock up and push you the wrong way, the bulls whooshing past you like a steamroller, and waiting for the next batch to come.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t think I ever made it more than a hundred meters down the track in either of the two runs I did.</p>\n<p>But it was the most exhilarating minute and a half of my life. On the track, it felt like a life-time. Within that minute and a half I made friends, I made enemies, stories came and went.</p>\n<p>I even saved a life. Maybe. A guy kneed me in the thigh, bounced off me into the middle of the track. I looked around. Nobody was helping the poor sod. Bulls were coming. I pulled him back towards the fence just as a mob of people descended upon us and nearly fell all over.</p>\n<p>On video the event unfolds in less than ten seconds. Slowed down. In person it felt like an epic tale.</p>\n<p>Adrenaline is a wonderful drug. It really is.</p>\n<p>Out there you can see everything. Every spec of dust. Every hair on a bull. Every stupid thing anybody does. Everything stands out. Everything.</p>\n<p>Infinite clarity. Infinite speed of thought. Heaven.</p>\n<p>And then it stopped. Over. We played chicken with death and we came out victorious.</p>\n<p>You could see it in the crowd. Shouts. High fives. Hugs. People screaming at the top of their lungs. Anything just to blow off steam, to announce to the world <em>&#8220;I survived and I have never been happier!&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>The kind of happiness you can only get from pointless pursuits. Happiness for happiness&#8217; sake.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 610px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Before bulls, after bulls\" alt=\"Before bulls, after bulls\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/18565?token=oG_eUuFVWhLrT256z2DfgItBYgjpTF9upv1ClnMQvSRCQP4DJFI6gZQG43UdXbxFfuTEFUw9f5BISoSKCSBnqnc\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Before bulls, after bulls</p></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"36cc3e23-7eaa-5a51-b9cf-ba24d713edfc"}}
