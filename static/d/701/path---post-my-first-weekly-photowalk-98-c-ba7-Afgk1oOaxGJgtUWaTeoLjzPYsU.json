{"data":{"wordpressPost":{"title":"My first weekly photowalk","content":"<p>Today I went on my first photowalk, an activity I promised myself I&#8217;d henceforth partake in at least once a week. First time I came into contact with photowalking was in some retweets by people on twitter that were talking about <a href=\"http://www.photowalklist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">photowalklist.com</a> and after observing for a while it touched something within me &#8211; the photographer I used to be quite some years ago (got my first proper camera at about 4 and then continued dabbling until about 15).</p>\n<p>Taking night-time photography of Ljubljana covered in the first snow of 2008 was bloody wonderful, sure I found out I need a tripod, yes I&#8217;m displeased with most of hte photos because they&#8217;re too bright and of course my fingers damn well nearly fell off. But that&#8217;s what photowalking is about, finding out how much you suck so you can improve.</p>\n<p>I will be making a photowalk post every week from now on and will include a lovely widget from <a href=\"http://www.fotonauts.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fotonauts</a> &#8211; a photography sharing website/app that I&#8217;m helping beta test.</p>\n<p>\n<script src=\"http://widgets.fotonauts.com/albums/5c9bc83f-5a32-40c8-8a94-7b6d343ac873/widget/width/400\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"504dd9a7-4b0d-59c1-9845-e26cf08a8aed"}}
