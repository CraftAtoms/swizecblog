Marvelous!</p>\n<p>Now the age long debate of who has the biggest coding schlong over at the pub can get fucking substantiated. Why try to remember everything when you&#8217;re drunk out of your mind? Just pull out an internet and SHOW them.</p>\n<p>As Hugh Laurie would say in Blackadder&#8217;s fourth series: Hoorah!!</p>\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://mytechne.com/user/Swizec/\">my coding schlong</a> if anyone&#8217;s interested.
