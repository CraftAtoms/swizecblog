I had just unwrapped my first ever 17&#8243; <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Flat panel display\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_panel_display\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">flat screen</a> <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Cathode ray tube\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">CRT monitor</a> and noticed my graphics card had two <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Video Graphics Array\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">VGA</a> outputs. Dual screen time!</p>\n<p>After a day of messing about with xorg.conf I had flawless video output on both the fancy new 17&#8243; flat screen and the 14&#8243; monitor that came with my first computer in 1995. I was <em>so</em> proud.</p>\n<p>Sure recompiling <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"KDE\" href=\"http://kde.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">KDE</a> with <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Xinerama\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinerama\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Xinerama</a> support took another three days (I was a Gentoo user back then), and launching a hardware accelerated game made the screens become mirrored, but it was amazeballs. I was a hacker just like in the movies! This was some 10 years ago.</p>\n<p>Ever since, I have been guarding that xorg.conf file with my life. It came with me through many linux distro changes, several monitors, and graphics cards, until a few years ago I deleted it.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu had become great enough that my painstakingly crafted configuration was no longer necessary. All I had to do was say <em>&#8220;Yes, I have two screens&#8221;</em>.</p>\n<p><a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Linux\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Linux</a> gives me exactly what I want from dual screen support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>launcher opens on screen you are currently working on</li>\n<li>the same top menu bar is repeated on both screens</li>\n<li>start menu, or dock, or whatever you call it, can be on both or just one screen depending on config</li>\n<li>you essentially have one big screen</li>\n<li>windows can be dragged seamlessly between screens</li>\n<li>windows can be placed across both screens</li>\n<li>desktop switching treats the whole workspace as a unit</li>\n<li>exposé feature shows windows on each screen</li>\n<li>dialogs open on active screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was my setup before I retired the aging linux box a few weeks ago:</p>\n<div style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Dual screen on Ubuntu\" alt=\"Dual screen on Ubuntu\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2950?token=dAQIM9W7hkI34hq0J8WiGY6sSAWgwYEcI43vE7dlMeuD0r_cBvzv5W_a_8h3_4BAOMr9ut_PBs8tzq93RXZQdCM\" width=\"1024\" height=\"363\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dual screen on Ubuntu</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You see, I&#8217;m a programmer. I don&#8217;t have a main screen and a secondary screen. I <em>need</em> a giant workspace so I can fit all my terminals and text editors and browser windows in front of me. One terminal, one emacs, and one browser is the minimum.</p>\n<p>But usually there&#8217;s two to three terminals, two browsers, two or more emacses and at least one chat program to keep in touch with the team. Before retiring my linux box I actually used the Mac as a dedicated third screen just-for-chats.</p>\n<h2>Enter <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Apple\" href=\"http://www.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"homepage\">Apple&#8217;s</a> <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Multi-monitor\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-monitor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Dual Screen</a></h2>\n<p>The first time I used dual screen on a Mac was a few years ago. I was shocked and horrified.</p>\n<p>The concept of having a main and a secondary screen was paramount to the experience. One monitor was The One You Are Using. It contained the top menu bar, the dock and whenever an app opened a new window or dialog, that&#8217;s where it would appear.</p>\n<p>Even Quicksilver always opened there.</p>\n<p>A few months ago I tried again and Apple had greatly improved. Sure they still thought I had a main and secondary screen and would only launch new apps on Main, but at least apps opened new windows and dialogs on the active screen.</p>\n<p>This was the old way.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>menu bar is on main screen</li>\n<li>dock is on main</li>\n<li>a Space (desktop) spans both screens and acts as a single workspace</li>\n<li>new apps only open on main screen</li>\n<li>disconnecting a screen causes some weirdness</li>\n<li>active corners are for both screens as a whole</li>\n<li>windows can be dragged between screens flawlessly</li>\n<li>windows can span both screens</li>\n<li>screenshots create two images &#8211; one for each screen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The situation has improved since my first try, especially regarding app dialogs and new app windows appearing where I&#8217;m actually looking. This system worked very well.</p>\n<p>If only they fixed those issues with new apps, menu bar and the dock &#8230;</p>\n<h2>Enter OS X Mavericks</h2>\n<p>Lo and behold, last night Mavericks came out with the grand promise of Apple finally fixing dual screen support. I updated instantly.</p>\n<p>Dual screen was the only thing I was excited about.</p>\n<p>Who cares about Finder tabs, I&#8217;ve had those on Linux and Windows since forever and never used them. Meh, folder tags are silly, and I guess the Calendar app is kinda prettier than it used to be, and the system behaves much smoother.</p>\n<p>No more glitchy desktop switching animations for the win!</p>\n<p>But damn it, Apple, we need to talk about that dual screen support. What the fuck?</p>\n<p>They fixed the only two features that bothered me &#8211; both screens are now main. New apps open on the active screen, both screens have the top menu bar and both have the dock. Perfect.</p>\n<p>But they ruined everything else.</p>\n<p>A desktop no longer spans both screens. You have to switch separately for each screen, which goes right against the idea of having one giant workspace with desktops forming project-based groups of windows.</p>\n<p>In their desire to make dual screen easier, they also made dragging windows from one screen to another feel off and windows can no longer span both screens.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 850px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Dual screen exposé\" alt=\"Dual screen exposé\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2951?token=fnaxLhZ4AaJkqxRf2tH_B7o5abatIUpGUNDV_bLb57TBpsUt2G9EOPlHQSGX481K0aBNTrmR4EfqMAI7rrZpAvo\" width=\"840\" height=\"242\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dual screen exposé</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 501px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Separating active and non-active screen makes sense\" alt=\"Separating active and non-active screen makes sense\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2952?token=lMVi3H1YJa8hENLV0PMnbEV-FXI7QhVhkc72IpEXfJTsdWXF4hu0woFeDM_7Oan8AdhCrT00frO-L6wQynRKwUc\" width=\"491\" height=\"185\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Separating active and non-active screen makes sense</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 727px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Dragging window, stage 1\" alt=\"Dragging window, stage 1\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2953?token=i8lMXO5eE0Sm_MlofHeffxPiNbZbt_9rYLCK5VEgegHdWx__EnzpPwQQZLqrIz9PHikjLklKyra5yTFcksReYQY\" width=\"717\" height=\"291\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dragging window, stage 1</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 727px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Dragging window, stage 2\" alt=\"Dragging window, stage 2\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2954?token=1RQq4_0oUle3A_LL-Zcy2bpnio1diAsXJiGbzXkF7_akXA3IzTjzrJagWx2RTFtFq1exHp0b0_Z6IZKu0efYqnI\" width=\"717\" height=\"407\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dragging window, stage 2</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div style=\"width: 727px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img title=\"Dragging window, stage 3\" alt=\"Dragging window, stage 3\" src=\"https://draftin.com:443/images/2955?token=wFWt2zFxjor_POZLCIgez_beXXzglrXQrsfARVw-ff-MIhH-M75Xkt_Yvdf6kPBHNQjxDd1dd8IaY45pLXr3RtA\" width=\"717\" height=\"314\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Dragging window, stage 3</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As you can see, dragging a window between screens reinforces the idea that both screens are separate entities. The part of the window where you&#8217;re holding it with the mouse, is active, the other vanishes as soon as you let go.</p>\n<p>In short, this is how dual screen works now:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>both screens are main</li>\n<li>menu bar on both, dock on both</li>\n<li>launching apps works the way you expect</li>\n<li>dialogs and new windows open where you want</li>\n<li>two screens are no longer a cohesive unit</li>\n<li>windows can&#8217;t span screens</li>\n<li>windows try too hard to show the transition between screens</li>\n<li>you have to switch each screen&#8217;s desktop separately</li>\n<li>active corners on both screens</li>\n<li>exposé and such affect both screens at once</li>\n<li>disconnecting a screen doesn&#8217;t cause weirdness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is an option on <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Mission Control (OS X)\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_%28OS_X%29\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Mission Control</a> settings to turn off separate desktops for each screen, but that also turns off the new features I do like.</p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s new dual screen support is a mixed bag of good and bad. Ideally we could have features from both worlds, but maybe they intend to fix this soon? I sure hope so.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m giving the new way a few more days and if I can&#8217;t get used to it, I&#8217;m switching back to the hell of having a secondary and a main screen.</p>\n<p>But at least Mavericks fixed the bug that disconnected wi-fi every time my screen went to sleep.</p>\n<div class=\"zemanta-pixie\" style=\"margin-top: 10px; height: 15px;\"><a class=\"zemanta-pixie-a\" title=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" href=\"http://www.zemanta.com/?px\"><img class=\"zemanta-pixie-img\" style=\"border: none; float: right;\" alt=\"Enhanced by Zemanta\" src=\"http://img.zemanta.com/zemified_e.png?x-id=b0d29892-45bc-407b-b9cb-2a3f0fabda6f\" /></a></div>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"374a7c8f-e35d-5207-a837-8a11c921b065"}}
