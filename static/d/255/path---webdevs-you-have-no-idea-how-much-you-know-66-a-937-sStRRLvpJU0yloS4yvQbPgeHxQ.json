Completely out of her depth (is usually an architecture student), but after two days she learned enough <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Adobe InDesign\" href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/main.html\" rel=\"homepage\">inDesign</a> to produce something we were both happy with.</p>\n<p>Even made it all interactive and stuff!</p>\n<p>But as every <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">good designer</span>Â <em>guy who turns a pdf into html+<a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets\" rel=\"wikipedia\">css</a>+js</em>Â knows, the tough part isn&#8217;t drawing pretty pictures and making the information architecture work &#8211; the hard part is making browsers understand this stuff, possibly in a cross-platform way, with a touch of responsiveness thrown in the mix.</p>\n<p>My days of being <em>that guy</em>Â ended towards the final throes of the War Against <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Tableless web design\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableless_web_design\" rel=\"wikipedia\">Tables for Layout</a>. Back when <em>:after { content: &#8220;:&#8221; }</em>Â and <em>:first-child</em>Â were the state of the art and <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"JQuery\" href=\"http://jquery.com/\" rel=\"homepage\">jQuery</a> was gaining widespread popularity.</p>\n<p>I can implement a half-baked <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"Front and back ends\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends\" rel=\"wikipedia\">frontend</a>, but turning designers&#8217; work into code is something I vowed never to do again! Soul crushingly maddening stuff that.</p>\n<p>Time to teach my fledgling webdesigner all about html and css.</p>\n<h2>The Web, from scratch</h2>\n<p>Until I started teaching <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ponywithhiccups\" target=\"_blank\">@ponywithhiccups</a> I had no idea web development was <em>this</em>Â complex.

No need to explain <em>too many</em>Â details ðŸ™‚</p>\n<p>She got a github account and groked the basics of using git pretty quickly. After every few characters you press <em>ctrl+s</em>, after a unit of work you <em>rescan, stage changes, commit</em>Â (in a gui) and when something works you <em>Â push</em>.</p>\n<p>Simple stuff.</p>\n<p>A few days later I sent her the first pull request &#8211; now she knows all about social coding. She understands the value of <a class=\"zem_slink\" title=\"GitHub\" href=\"http://github.com\" rel=\"homepage\">Github</a> is that people can see what you&#8217;re doing and pitch in to help when they want to. You have to <em>pull</em>Â their code to your local repository, then you get to play with <em>merge conflicts</em>Â and finally push it all back to Github.</p>\n<p>She can even use <em>gh-pages</em>!</p>\n<p>Although in retrospect, maybe I should have told her she can check out the html locally and doesn&#8217;t need to update gh-pages every time &#8230;</p>\n<h2>Teaching afresh</h2>\n<p>The best thing about teaching someone all this stuff from scratch, is that she is a completely clean slate. No preconceptions of how code works, no idea that tables used to be for layout, noÂ <em>&lt;font&gt;</em>Â tag or anything else that is absolutely atrocious.</p>\n<div style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teaching-800.jpg\"><img class=\"zemanta-img-inserted zemanta-img-configured\" title=\"Teaching in Thekchen Choling\" src=\"http://swizec.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/300px-Teaching-8001.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching in Thekchen Choling\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>\n<p>Here is a designer that will never know the world before html5 and css3, that considers this stuff as normal, not as something new and somewhat scary.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a good thing!</p>\n<p>Back when I was learning webdev the best advice for using table-less design was <em>display: table-cell;</em>Â Yup, it was!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I had no-one to teach me cleanly.
