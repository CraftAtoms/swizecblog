Shorter than 500 words. With pictures. Livecoding happens almost <strong>every Sunday at 2pm PDT</strong> on multiple channels.

Grab your phone, point it at a thing, find that thing&#8217;s RGB color.</p>\n<p>Not sure <em>why</em>, but it&#8217;s a fun little way to play with React Native and device camera. We found a package called <a href=\"https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera\">react-native-camera</a> that makes camera integration easy.</p>\n<p>Import the project, use <code><Camera /></code> to render a live view of the camera in your app. That was easier than I thought it would be. Guess that&#8217;s the benefit of being late to the game. Others have already built the things that are hard. Now you just gotta put them together like LEGO pieces in novel ways.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the main benefit of React Native isn&#8217;t it? Components that do stuff and fit together. Little glue code to write. Everything fits.</p>\n<p>My favorite discovery was Quicktime&#8217;s movie recording mode. You can show your phone screen on your main screen.</p>\n<p>No more this:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/WtJeBOQ.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>This:</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jayjVA6.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n</figure>\n<p>Isn&#8217;t that better? I think it is.</p>\n<p>Thanks blackburn1911 for showing me that trick. It&#8217;s going to improve future livecoding sessions and <a href=\"http://reactnative.school\">React Native School</a> videos.</p>\n<p>Hm &#8230; this isn&#8217;t a very long livecoding recap. Could we really have done so little? Was I <em>that</em> wasted from running a lot on Sunday morning? ?</p>\n<p>I mean, we found three JavaScript image manipulation libraries that are going to help us find color codes, but we didn&#8217;t get to use them before our time was up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/oliver-moran/jimp\">jimp</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://grafijs.org/\">grafi.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://camanjs.com/\">camanjs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we discovered that even if you&#8217;re saving photos temporarily, you still need Photo Library permissions. Forget to ask and your app will crash. That part was confusing.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s basically it &#8230; damn. Next time I should drink more caffeine.</p>\n<p>Here is next day&#8217;s followup session. That was fun too, we learned that my computer is crazy slow.</p>\n<p><iframe width=\"853\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSVw5f5akoI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Swizec Blog","subtitle":"Fetch Data From Local WP Install"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a0aa199e-d877-53d3-a461-20bfd74703a6"}}
