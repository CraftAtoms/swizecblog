<p>A juice cleanse is easy, you just drink juice for three days and feel like crap.</p>
<p>I tried writing this post last night, on the eve of day 3. After staring at the blank screen for an hour I gave up. It&#8217;s impossible to write on an empty stomach. It&#8217;s hard even to think.</p>
<p>After three days of nothing but juices your mind feels like it does when you&#8217;d had just four hours of sleep. Except you aren&#8217;t tired. You&#8217;re just slow of mind.</p>
<p>Erd√∂s once said about amphetamines that <em>&#8220;[on amphetamines], when I looked at a piece of blank paper my mind was filled with ideas. [Without amphetamines] all I see is a blank piece of paper.&#8221;</em> Starving for three days has about the same effect.</p>
<h2 id="day-1">Day 1</h2>
<p>61.5kg (135.6lbs)</p>
<p>The first day I was fine. Hungry. Annoyed. Irritable. But fine. The more the day progressed, the less hungry I felt.</p>
<p>I made sure to drink every juice over the course of an hour and I had plenty of water. Although I was still dehydrated all the time, which was surprising.</p>
<p>Who would&#8217;ve thought they&#8217;d be dehydrated when switching to a liquid diet with copious helpings of water?</p>
<p>But it makes sense. A small portion of chicken (100g) contains almost half a glass of water. Chicken is 65% water <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/42a903e2-451d-40ea-897a-22dc74ef6e1c/Water_in_Meats.pdf?MOD=AJPERES">[1]</a>. The story is similar for other foods. Dry rice is 14% water, cooked rice is 70% water, dry pasta is 22% water etc.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if you look at a food label and sum up the values, what&#8217;s left is water. One of my normal meals contains over a cup (~240ml) of water in the food itself.</p>
<p>When you switch to 8 cups of juice per day, all that water needs to come from somewhere else. That means drinking water all day erryday to the point it becomes a logistics problem between refilling your water bottle and getting work done.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m sure a big part of the problem is also that there&#8217;s no food holding the water in your belly so it passes through quicker. While I don&#8217;t think I peed much more often than usual, my pee was definitely clearer.</p>
<h2 id="day-1---workout">Day 1 &#8211; workout</h2>
<p>Here&#8217;s where I went off track for the cleanse. I bought a <a href="http://cancancleanse.com/">Can Can power cleanse</a>, which is meant for people with higher caloric needs. It gives you 1300 calories per day to work with.</p>
<p>Can Can says this is enough for light workouts, but doing a normal hour and a half of boxing practice is anything but light. It burns some 800 calories.</p>
<p>Doing my normal workout routine was stupid, but I wanted to see what happens. I didn&#8217;t care about the cleansing properties of my cleanse, I wanted to see what a pre-fight or a pre-photoshoot cut feels like.</p>
<p>Boxers go through a rigorous cutting regime before a fight where they drink minimum water, eat minimum foods, and try to drop a <a class="zem_slink" title="Weight class (boxing)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_class_%28boxing%29" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">weight class</a> or two. Then after weigh-in they try to gain as much of it back as possible.</p>
<p>Of course they keep training through all of this because that makes it more effective. Although it does make your training less effective.</p>
<p>On Day 1 my workout felt &#8230; okay. I wasn&#8217;t in the best of shapes, but I wasn&#8217;t in the worst of shapes either. I did just fine.</p>
<p>But I <em>was</em> more sore than usual. And after practice I nearly died when my body started eating itself demanding dinner.</p>
<p>I persevered.</p>
<p>Evening weight: 61kg (134.4lbs) Caloric deficit: ~1500kcal</p>
<h2 id="day-2">Day 2</h2>
<p>60.5kg (133.4lbs)</p>
<p>Day two was smashing.</p>
<p>Some of the euphoria from Day 1 was gone, but I was doing great. There was no more hunger. Juices seemed to last forever and I could do whatever I wanted.</p>
<p>By now I had figured out an adjusted schedule to the cleanse that better fit my day and I was flying. To my surprise I discovered that caffeine from tea and calorie-free monsters kicks in much harder and faster on an empty stomach.</p>
<p>Woo \o/</p>
<h2 id="day-2---workout">Day 2 &#8211; workout</h2>
<p>But working out was hell. Like &#8230; hell.</p>
<p>Once more I did my normal hour and a half of boxing but it was a waste of time. I felt weak, I couldn&#8217;t throw hard punches, I couldn&#8217;t throw fast punches, I couldn&#8217;t keep my arms up.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t even work up a proper sweat. My t-shirt would be as drenched as if I had fallen into a swimming after a normal training session, this time it was barely moist.</p>
<p>My trainer laughed at me and wondered why I can&#8217;t work the same as usual. A guy scoffed and said that only girls do cleanses when I refused to spar with him. He would&#8217;ve destroyed me.</p>
<p>Hell, a double-end bag almost destroyed me when it flew into my face because I was too slow.</p>
<p>That night I slept. A lot.</p>
<p>Evening weight: 61.5kg (135.6lbs) Caloric deficit: ~1300kcal</p>
<h2 id="day-3">Day 3</h2>
<p>59.5kg (131.2lbs)</p>
<p>On the morning of day 3 I couldn&#8217;t for the life of me get out of bed. My alarm rang at 7:30am.</p>
<p>When I took a shower at 8:30am the alarm was off. I assume I turned it off the second it rang. I don&#8217;t remember doing it.</p>
<p>After my shower I sat down on the bed and fell asleep. It was 9:30am before I was alive again. Time to go to work.</p>
<p>No way in hell I was doing my Wednesday morning 8km run. Nope. Couldn&#8217;t even stand very well.</p>
<p>The longboard ride to work is a blur. Work is a blur. Everything is a blur. I think I pushed some things forward at work, I think I closed some pull requests, I may have made sure some people do their part, but mostly I just sat there staring at the screen.</p>
<p>Staring at my code, trying to see the solution that so easily pops out on a normal day. But my code was a blur. An ocean of numbers and letters that mean nothing.</p>
<p>I felt faint all day and if somebody confronted me about something, I probably would have broken down crying.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bizarre feeling like that. When you&#8217;re not hungry, not tired, not irritable, not annoyed, not anything in particular. Just &#8230; weak.</p>
<p>Sometimes I switch my Wednesday morning run for an evening run. This Wednesday I didn&#8217;t go for a run after work, I just lay on my bed for four hours before I mustered the power to go deal with my email inbox for the day.</p>
<p>Evening weight: 61.2kg (134.9lbs) Caloric deficit: ~700kcal</p>
<h2 id="day-4---fin">Day 4 &#8211; fin</h2>
<p>59.0kg (130lbs)</p>
<p>This morning I ate the most delicious bagel I have ever eaten. A cheap Thomas whole wheat bagel from Safeway. It&#8217;s too sweet for bread, too fluffy for a bagel, but it was the tastiest thing I have ever tasted.</p>
<p>I had it with some cottage cheese. The cottage cheese tasted the same it always does &#8211; bland and nutritious.</p>
<p>Now my stomach hurts. That was too much food to start with after a cleanse.</p>
<p>Evening weight: 61kg, probably Caloric deficit: none, hopefully</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h2>
<p>So what did I learn about juice cleanses? I didn&#8217;t go into my cleanse with the belief that my digestive tract needs a reset or that there&#8217;s such a thing as a body detox.</p>
<p>Hell, even if there was such a thing as a body detox, I kept drinking caffeine and calorie-free energy drinks. I would have died without those. And I didn&#8217;t do much to cleanse my mind, which is supposed to be part of a cleanse.</p>
<p>But what I learned is that:</p>
<ul id="draft_check_box_list_0">
<li>the pre-fight/pre-photo-op cut is real, it works</li>
<li>it&#8217;s not too hard to lose 2.5kg of water-weight in 3 days</li>
<li>cleansing is unhealthy, most def</li>
<li>cleansing does make you look more defined</li>
<li>juice cleanses have more sugar than my normal diet</li>
<li>food cravings are less of a problem than I thought, didn&#8217;t happen to me</li>
<li>real hunger is a big problem, feeling hungry doesn&#8217;t happen much</li>
<li>having all food prepared in advance by someone else saves a shitload of time</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this has had any lasting impact on my body shape, or on my weight, or on my dietary habits. But I know I can do it and if I ever start boxing competitively, I know for a fact that I too can drop a whole weight class in just a few days.</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
