<div id="_mcePaste">To the entire Black race living in America, we, the Adamic, pink complexioned race (better known to you as the White race) that came to these shores from Europe, England, Scotland, Ireland, and Iceland, apologize for freeing you from slavery by fighting a horrible war among ourselves that cost the lives of almost two million of our own race. We apologize for continuing to fight among ourselves over that very issue, even though you&#8217;ve never told us you appreciate our freeing you.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for splitting to pieces our entire race the world over to take sides with you to help you survive and become a freer race. We apologize for forcing the rest of the world to outlaw the slavery which your ancestors had practiced for thousands of years, even though many nations on your home continent still practice it today.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for thinking we could civilize you when you have proven that it is indeed an impossible feat, a feat beyond anything we could have ever imagined.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for teaching you to add and subtract (what little you can), thereby enabling you to run a household and pay your bills (what few you will) and count your children other than on your fingers and sometimes toes when you have so many you run out of fingers.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for providing you with medical care instead of leaving you under the witch doctors you used before we arrived, as a result of which you have been able to survive all sorts of diseases to multiply in massive numbers beyond what you could have without these aides.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for building schools for you which we have had to repair over and over after you vandalized them beyond use. We apologize for inventing computers and the Internet, neither of which you use very much, but when you do use them it&#8217;s mostly to bash our race.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for building factories and businesses that employ you, if you so desire to work. We apologize for creating millions of bureaucratic jobs within our government system simply to give you employment, instead of leaving you to find work on your own.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for promoting and buying your music, although you refuse to buy ours. We apologize for talking and acting as you do, although you refuse to talk and act as we do.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for placing you in our movies and TV shows and elevating you to a fictional, heroic level that you have never reached in real life. We apologize for creating this false image of yourselves in your minds, for we realize after 400 years of trying to help you that you cannot solve problems and provide leadership and create original thoughts; and the image we&#8217;ve placed in your minds causes you to live in a delusional world. For that we truly apologize.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for creating quota systems and forced employment programs to make sure you have the best jobs, if you so desire to work. We apologize for thinking we could educate you so that you could learn to build and help others, when you obviously have only the ability to tear down and take from others.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for giving you welfare and food stamps, with the result that for four generations over half of your race has not had to work, except in makesift type of jobs in our governments and bureaucracies.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for promoting your children in school as if they could understand basic arithmetic and grammar, such as multiplication and past participles, when we should have made sure they were accustomed to manual labor so that we would not have had to make up jobs for them in our governments dusting seats with their butts.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for developing farms in our own lands which you have never been able to do, and that to this day feed most of your race still living in Africa. We apologize for coming to Africa and building farms, from which you have now run us off of and have devastated beyond use, forcing us to continue feeding you.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for creating the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank (WB) and U.S. Government Foreign Aid Programs and hundreds of charities that funnel billions of our tax dollars and charitable donations to nations around the world run by your race, all because your race cannot take care of itself by itself anywhere you live.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for giving you the right to vote so you could take over all our major cities and turn them into high-taxed, crime-ridden cess pools that no civilized human being can live in.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for creating the term &#8220;reverend,&#8221; which your leaders use to give themselves credentials and which their actions have denigrated beyond repair, with the result that no decent person would call himself &#8220;reverend,&#8221; much less a Christian</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for trying to come up with an AIDS vaccine to stop the epidemic spread of AIDS in Africa, AIDS being a disease that you created and passed on to us after having sexual intercourse with monkeys and then with one of our idiotic race-mixers who then passed it on to the rest of the world.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for providing you with warm, custom-made garments instead of the animal skins and leaves that you wore before we arrived. We apologize for providing you with shoes instead of leaving you barefooted as you were before we arrived in Africa.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for teaching you how to clean yourselves and your homes, and how to sanitize the water you drink to keep you from getting even more dreadful diseases than the rest of your race gets that still lives in Africa. We apologize for teaching you to cook your foods, which keeps you from getting the hundreds of parasitic diseases that your race gets that still lives on your home continent of Africa.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for providing you with solidly built, heated, and cooled homes with grass yards instead of the straw huts and dirt yards you were living in before we arrived, and in which most of your race is still living in in Africa.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for inventing sports so that you can make millions of dollars and live like kings, then kill and rape people with impunity, as O.J. Heisman-Trophy-Winner Simpson and Mike Heavy-Weight-Champion-of-the-World Tyson have done, as well as many others among your race.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for producing such beautiful people for you to race-mix with, and if they won&#8217;t voluntarily mix, you often casually rape them as if you were eating a piece of fried chicken.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for building thousands of prisons around the nation to house dangerous criminals, of which your race makes up over sixty percent even though you&#8217;re only thirteen percent of the U.S. population, and this at an expense of billions of dollars and manpower every year.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for taking precious metals from the earth on your home continent of Africa, metals which you neither knew were there nor how to use them if you had known they were there, but which you love to puncture and cover your bodies with in the most tawdry way imaginable.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for those among us who have established charitable organizations, donated billions of dollars and hours of time, and have devoted their entire lives to make life easier and better for your race, although most often to no positive result.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for all the stupid White ministers whom your race has martyred in Africa where they were trying to evangelize you to a faith that you can&#8217;t understand nor do you want to; yet when you claim to join it soon pervert it with the Voodooistic concepts you have inherited from your forefathers.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for building highways and railroads and for inventing flying machines that you could never have invented but which you use everyday to move about, yet without thinking or appreciating their origins in the least.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for paying the majority of both federal and state taxes, to maintain the governments which protect and promote you but fight against our own people at every turn.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for some members of our race who worship the monstrosities your genes have created, such as Jacko the Wacko and Little Fruity Richard and Dennis Nutman Rodman and Don Electrified King and Daryl Coke-Head Strawberry and Whitney Whacked-Out-Screaming Houston and Cassius If-Only-I-Be-White-But-I&#8217;m-Really-Black Clay and Tiger Adamic-Hater Woods and Whoopi Thinks-She&#8217;s-White Goldberg and Oprah Interview-a-Nut New-Age-Goof Winfrey and Ru Triple-Freak Paul and Morgan Act-White-But-Hate-White Freeman and Sammy Convert-To-The-Christ-haters-Religion Davis and Colin Have-A-Black-Pet-In-The-White-House Powell, to name only a few.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for defeating the major part of the communist threat which cost us several trillion dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, but whose doctrines you still wish to have implemented on the backs of our race to further torture us and tear us down.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for spending over $2 trillion dollars on welfare and food stamps in the last thirty-five years, funds which your race received the majority of, although you are a small minority among us.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for introducing you to the rule of law under a republican form of government, a government that has gone abroad to keep your own warring nations from slaughtering other members of your race by the hundreds of thousands as they did year in and year out before we arrived, and still do every time we leave them alone and do not intervene.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for teaching you to read a language that contains more than a few words and a couple of hand signs, which has allowed you to take part in our philosophies, our culture, our art, our industry, our collegial nature, and our freedom, even though as soon as you get around them you pervert them.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">For surely, if you could not read, how could you have learned the teachings of Karl Marx, Mao Tse Sung, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, Nikolai Lenin, Howard Zinn, the Damocrat Party, the Neo-cons in the Republicoward Party, and others who hate our race, and have brainwashed you into believing our race is evil and that you are severely oppressed?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We apologize for placing you under the form of government that our own forefathers died to create, and for which you are helping to destroy, instead of leaving you under the anarchy you lived under before we arrived.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">For all these wrongs we&#8217;ve carried out against you, we apologize deeply and unreservedly, and if you will please accept our apology, we shall happily and immediately take back all of the above mentioned evils we have cast upon you and return you to your home continent, if you so desire.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We would with the greatest of glee and cheer even provide you with a nice, little stipend for traveling money, if you&#8217;d go and take your race-traitor wives and husbands and Mulatto children with you.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We have enjoyed having you here, but because you claim we&#8217;ve been, and are still being, so mean to you, we&#8217;d like to atone by helping you get back to where you came from.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">You could live in peace without our persecuting you anymore, and we could save ourselves trillions of dollars over the next few years by shrinking our governments and emptying our prisons. We could take hundreds of thousands of security guards and police officers around the country off their jobs and put them to more productive use, and we could celebrate our own culture without offending you anymore.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">Moreover, we could take the three-point shot and the forty-five second shot clock out of basketball which would return it to a game of plays and strategies, instead of the run and gun show our enemies have tailored especially for you. We could place the &#8220;palming penalty&#8221; and the &#8220;walking penalty&#8221; and the &#8220;charging penalty&#8221; back in to slow the game down to the point that defense and brains matter.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">We could place the &#8220;bump and run&#8221; rule back in football and have referees start calling &#8220;offensive pass interference&#8221; again, to change the game to one where something more than straight-ahead speed is what matters. The &#8220;taunting rule&#8221; and the &#8220;roughing the quarterback rule&#8221; that we had to implement because of you, we could do away with completely, because civility would automatically come back into the game.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">The race traitors of our race who hate their own culture and heritage could go with you, and we won&#8217;t offend them anymore either. For after a few generations of mixing with your race they would disappear into the dark tar-mix which your dominant design-genes make up.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste">What say? Do you accept our apology? Do we have a deal? Please let us know, soon!</div>

We apologize for some members of our race who worship the monstrosities your genes have created, such as Jacko the Wacko and Little Fruity Richard and Dennis Nutman Rodman and Don Electrified King and Daryl Coke-Head Strawberry and Whitney Whacked-Out-Screaming Houston and Cassius If-Only-I-Be-White-But-I&#8217;m-Really-Black Clay and Tiger Adamic-Hater Woods and Whoopi Thinks-She&#8217;s-White Goldberg and Oprah Interview-a-Nut New-Age-Goof Winfrey and Ru Triple-Freak Paul and Morgan Act-White-But-Hate-White Freeman and Sammy Convert-To-The-Christ-haters-Religion Davis and Colin Have-A-Black-Pet-In-The-White-House Powell, to name only a few.<br />
We apologize for defeating the major part of the communist threat which cost us several trillion dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives, but whose doctrines you still wish to have implemented on the backs of our race to further torture us and tear us down.<br />
We apologize for spending over $2 trillion dollars on welfare and food stamps in the last thirty-five years, funds which your race received the majority of, although you are a small minority among us.<br />
We apologize for introducing you to the rule of law under a republican form of government, a government that has gone abroad to keep your own warring nations from slaughtering other members of your race by the hundreds of thousands as they did year in and year out before we arrived, and still do every time we leave them alone and do not intervene.<br />
We apologize for teaching you to read a language that contains more than a few words and a couple of hand signs, which has allowed you to take part in our philosophies, our culture, our art, our industry, our collegial nature, and our freedom, even though as soon as you get around them you pervert them.<br />
For surely, if you could not read, how could you have learned the teachings of Karl Marx, Mao Tse Sung, Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky, Nikolai Lenin, Howard Zinn, the Damocrat Party, the Neo-cons in the Republicoward Party, and others who hate our race, and have brainwashed you into believing our race is evil and that you are severely oppressed?<br />
We apologize for placing you under the form of government that our own forefathers died to create, and for which you are helping to destroy, instead of leaving you under the anarchy you lived under before we arrived.<br />
For all these wrongs we&#8217;ve carried out against you, we apologize deeply and unreservedly, and if you will please accept our apology, we shall happily and immediately take back all of the above mentioned evils we have cast upon you and return you to your home continent, if you so desire.<br />
We would with the greatest of glee and cheer even provide you with a nice, little stipend for traveling money, if you&#8217;d go and take your race-traitor wives and husbands and Mulatto children with you.<br />
We have enjoyed having you here, but because you claim we&#8217;ve been, and are still being, so mean to you, we&#8217;d like to atone by helping you get back to where you came from.<br />
You could live in peace without our persecuting you anymore, and we could save ourselves trillions of dollars over the next few years by shrinking our governments and emptying our prisons. We could take hundreds of thousands of security guards and police officers around the country off their jobs and put them to more productive use, and we could celebrate our own culture without offending you anymore.<br />
Moreover, we could take the three-point shot and the forty-five second shot clock out of basketball which would return it to a game of plays and strategies, instead of the run and gun show our enemies have tailored especially for you. We could place the &#8220;palming penalty&#8221; and the &#8220;walking penalty&#8221; and the &#8220;charging penalty&#8221; back in to slow the game down to the point that defense and brains matter.<br />
We could place the &#8220;bump and run&#8221; rule back in football and have referees start calling &#8220;offensive pass interference&#8221; again, to change the game to one where something more than straight-ahead speed is what matters. The &#8220;taunting rule&#8221; and the &#8220;roughing the quarterback rule&#8221; that we had to implement because of you, we could do away with completely, because civility would automatically come back into the game.<br />
The race traitors of our race who hate their own culture and heritage could go with you, and we won&#8217;t offend them anymore either. For after a few generations of mixing with your race they would disappear into the dark tar-mix which your dominant design-genes make up.<br />
What say? Do you accept our apology? Do we have a deal? Please let us know, soon!</p>
